    g noted that while he and his beloved both loved to dine, they had 
    strikingly different tastes. She favored fish and veggies . He still loved a 
    good cut of beef. Many couples shared those differences. So the Chef gs 
    experience was designed to be a wonderful blend of both the male and female 
    elements. The perfect harmony of the Oriental philosophy of Yin and Yang.<br>

    the most-talked-about trademark of Chef g’s is The Journey, “Create your own 
    Steak and Seafood Platters” that are custom designed by those at the table. 
    Journeys are an array of three different menu items presented with a 
    flourish in a silver chafing dish, kept warm throughout the meal. As guests 
    dine and share their food, creating their own blends of flavors and 
    sensations, the<br>

    To some diners, Chef g’s meat and seafood Journeys may seem like Paradise, 
    so many exotic tastes at once...<br>
    <br>
    Restaurants are very risky and he has gone to great lengths to make sure he 
    stands out...<br>
    <br>
    Among the touches that makes Chef g’s memorable: Guest wearing black get 
    black napkins. Female diners who feel a chill are given shawls.<br>

    Gower creates is mind-blowing, and his sauces are scrumptious. The

    My favorite dish here was the side of skillet potatoes, which tells you 
    something. They are crunchy-skinned, onion laced, a model of their kind. ( 
    if only a similar dish at Papas Steakhouse were this good.). The potatoes 
    also went particularly well with a range of those signature sauces, from the 
    creamy wasabi “sky sauce” to the mellow and delicious Tabasco, bacon 
    Molasses butter.<br>

    <p class="textcontent"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Based on our first 
    visit, Chef g’s could succeed at this formerly snake-bit location. We tried 
    a filet Mignon perfectly complemented with Blue Cheese butter ( about 15 
    sauces were available to sample), and also liked our crab-crusted snapper, 
    crisp skillet potatoes, and iceberg lettuce with blue cheese and bacon.<br>

    feels like storming. No doubt, for many of Chef g’s clientele, the 
    insurrection works.<br>
