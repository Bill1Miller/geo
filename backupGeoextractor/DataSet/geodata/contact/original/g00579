<A NAME="1"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Is it true that I can't get my comics by e-mail for free anymore? </FONT></A><BR><BR>

Not exactly. We've replaced Comics by E-mail with two new programs, called Comic Basic and Comics Extra. With Comic Basic you can get one strip by e-mail for free. However, you're limited to only one, e-mailed six days a week. If you want to get multiple comics by e-mail all week long then you can sign up for Comics Extra. There is a fee for this, but you can get as many comics as you like and a lot of additional features as well.  We also offer Comics Extra Gold, which has all the features of Comics Extra, plus the ability to search our comic archives.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="2"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Why did you start charging a fee?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

We wanted to create an enhanced product on Comics.com, and give all our members what they've been asking for. As we started to do that, we saw how many great things we could offer but also realized that to do it to the best of our ability it would be necessary for us to charge a fee. Comics Extra subscribers get premium content, customized e-mails, extended archives, personalized pages and lots of other fun extras.  Comics Extra Gold subscribers get all this, plus the ability to search our comic archives.  We're sure that you will agree that all of the awesome new features and Members-only areas are worth the small annual fee. But for those of you who may not, we still offer the main website for free so you can continue to enjoy the comics.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="3"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Why am I not getting multiple e-mails anymore?  I'm only getting one.</FONT></A><BR><BR>

We recently replaced Comics by E-mail with two new programs: Comic Basic and Comics Extra.  All subscribers who did not convert their account to one of our new programs have been automatically switched to a free Comic Basic account.  With Comic Basic you get one comic by e-mail and any newsletters that you had been signed up for previously (the DNRC and the Comics Update).  If you would like to get more than one comic by e-mail then you need to become a Comics Extra subscriber, which requires a fee.
<BR><BR>

<A NAME="4"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: How do I make changes to my account?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

You can make changes to your account by going to your My Account page.  If you're a Comic Basic subscriber you just sign-in and you will be on your My Account page right away.  If you are a Comics Extra or Comics Extra Gold subscriber you should sign-in and then click on the "My Account" link on your My Comics Page.  Once you get to the My Account page you can check or change your e-mail address and password, the comics you are receiving, the type of subscription you currently have, and your payment information.<BR>

You can do this by signing-in to and (for Comics Extra Users) clicking on the "Edit My Comics" button on your My Comics Page or (for Comic Basic users) the bottom "edit" button on the My Account page.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="6"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Can I change my e-mail address and password?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

Yes, you can. You can do this at your My Account page.  See the answer to the question "How do I make changes to my account?" above for more details.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="7"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Can I still get the Comics Update and DNRC Newsletters for free?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

<A NAME="21"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: I signed up and got a confirmation mail but why am I not getting my Comics e-mail?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

First, make sure you have opted to receive the daily My Comics e-mail.  Do this by logging into your account and going to "Edit This Page".  Make sure the box that says "Receive your selected comics by e-mail daily" is checked. If it is, we suggest checking with your Internet Service Provider and/or technical support. Many sites block our mail because they misidentify us as spam. They should be able to provide you with assistance.<BR><BR>

If the issue is still not resolved after communicating with them please contact us at <A HREF="mailto:support@comicmembers.com">support@comicmembers.com</A>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="22"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: If I'm a Comics Extra or Comics Extra Gold subscriber can I put a copy of a strip in my newsletter, publication, Website, etc. whenever I want?</FONT></A><BR>
<BR>

Please do not use any comic strips or materials from the Comics.com Website without getting permission from United Media first.  Your membership to Comics Extra does not grant you reprint rights to our copyrighted materials.  Please see the section called "Using United Media Comics" in this FAQ for more information on how to obtain reprint rights.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="23"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Can I temporarily stop receiving my comics by e-mail?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

Yes, you can.  While signed-in to your account go to Edit This Page and uncheck the box that says "Receive your selected comics by e-mail daily." You will still have access to your My Comics Page, so you can still read your strips while on the go.  To restart your e-mail delivery, just go back to Edit This Page and check the box once more.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="8"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Why aren't my strips opening up? Why can't I see the strip in my e-mail?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

There are several different answers to this question:<BR>
- Make sure that you are not offline.  You need to have a live connection for the strip to come up. <BR><BR>

- Your Internet Service Provider or company may be preventing you from receiving the images with either a SPAM filter or a firewall.<BR><BR>

- In order to see the comics in our e-mails, you need to be using an e-mail system that works with HTML mail.<BR><BR>

Some of the e-mail clients that display our daily e-mails correctly are:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>All webmail platforms (Hotmail, Yahoo, etc.)
<LI>Outlook 98 and greater on Windows
<LI>Outlook Express on Windows
<LI>AOL on Mac OSX
<LI>Mail in OSX
<LI>Eudora 5.2 in Windows
</UL>

If you're getting e-mails with missing graphics or incorrect formatting (or both), it's because your e-mail client doesn't work with HTML mail.  Some of the e-mail clients that are incompatible with HTML mail are:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>AOL for Mac other that OSX (won't display HTML mail)
<LI>AOL on NT (won't display HTML mail)
<LI>AOL 7 on Windows (graphics won't load)
<LI>Eudora on Mac (formatting is incorrect)
<LI>Lotus Mail (formatting is incorrect)

<FONT CLASS="blue">Features and Content</FONT><BR><BR>

<A NAME="24"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: There is a strip on your site that isn't offered in Comics Extra.  Why?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

We appreciate that you want all your favorite comics included in Comics Extra and we're working to deliver them.  As much as we would like to offer as many comics as possible to you, due to contractual obligations for some comic titles, certain strips cannot be included in Comics Extra at this time.
<BR><BR>
Comics Extra is an evolving program that will constantly be improved and expanded upon.  We have many great features included in Comics Extra currently and we'll continue to provide our members with more stuff going forward, including additional comics.
<BR><BR>

<A NAME="25"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: What is "My Library"?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

"My Library" is like a scrapbook of your favorite individual strips.  If a particular strip strikes you as funny one day just put it into "My Library" and it will always be there for you to read whenever you need a laugh.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="26"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: There are no "Desktop Extras" for the strips I like. Why?
</FONT></A><BR><BR>

We're currently working on creating more fabulous screensavers, wallpapers and e-cards for members to enjoy, so check back often.  Your ideas are always welcome too, so please let us know what you would like us to create and we'll do our best to meet your requests.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="27"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: How far back do the archives go?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

How far back each comic strip archive goes varies depending on the title. Right now, the average archive is about two to three years.  For &quot;Peanuts,&quot; &quot;Dilbert,&quot; and &quot;For Better of For Worse&quot; our archives extend to the very beginning of these titles. On average, the archives for our editorial cartoons go back approximately five to six years. <BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="28"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Some comic strips seem to only go back for a limited amount of time.  Why?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

Because of contractual obligations, we are only allowed to provide limited archives for some strips.  There are published comic strip collections for most of the comics we offer.  If you can't find a particular strip online you may want to check out our online store for available books.  We also provide book information on the comic pages for individual titles.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="30"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: How can I get the columns and editorial cartoons in my e-mail?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

Sorry, but we currently do not provide the columns or the editorial cartoons by e-mail.<BR><BR><BR>

<FONT CLASS="blue">Search Questions</FONT><BR><BR>

<A NAME="73"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Who can search?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

Only subscribers with a Comics Extra Gold membership are entitled to search our archives.  If you currently have a Comic Basic or Comics Extra membership and would like to view comics through our search engine, you must sign-in and upgrade your account via your My Account page.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="74"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: What is the difference between "Keywords" and "Character Dialogue"?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

"Keywords" are words and phrases which are used to identify the prominent themes, ideas, objects, settings and actions in a particular strip.  "Character Dialogue" refers to the words and characters which appear in the strip.  For the most inclusive search results, we recommend that you select "Both" when performing your search.    
<p>
To find specific dialogue from a particular strip, just type the dialogue within quotation marks.  Our search engine will look for direct matches based on the exact words within the quotation marks.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="75"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Why can't I search all of the features on Comics.com?</FONT></A><BR>
<BR>

It is our goal to make all of the features on Comics.com available for searching.  Unfortunately, due to licensing agreements with our artists this is not always possible.  If there is a particular strip which you would like to search for, please let us know.  Your opinions matter to us!<BR><BR>

<A NAME="76"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: How can I modify my search results?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

Comics.com's search engine supports the search modifiers &quot;AND&quot; and &quot;NOT.&quot; Just add these capitalized words in-between your search terms to get more specific search results. The modifier &quot;AND&quot; will bring results which only have both of your search terms. The modifier &quot;NOT&quot; will bring results which only have your first search term without your second term. If you enter more than one term into your query, our search engine automatically inserts the modifier &quot;OR&quot; in-between the terms in order to bring back the greatest possible number of matches. <BR><BR>

<A NAME="77"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Are the searches case sensitive? </FONT></A><BR><BR>

Our search queries are not case sensitive.  It is not necessary to use proper capitalization in order to create successful searches.  <BR><BR>

<A NAME="78"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: How come I can't find a specific strip (for example, Peanuts) when I perform a search?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

Some of our comic properties, including Peanuts, are reprinted after their original publication date.  In the case of Peanuts, the strip you may have recently seen on our website or in your local newspaper was originally published several years ago.  To find strips through our search engine which have been reprinted, make sure you are using the original publication date within the date range field.  If you are not sure of the original publication date, simply leave the date fields blank.  You may get more results, but you should still find what you are looking for.  <BR><BR>

<FONT CLASS="blue">Fees, Payment and Billing</FONT><BR><BR>

<A NAME="32"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Can I change my credit card and billing information?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

Yes, you can. The process is the same as changing your e-mail address and password. Once you're in your Comics Extra area, click the "My Account" link. This will take you to a page where you can make any necessary changes.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="33"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Why have the subscription prices changed?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

Just as retail stores offer specials, so does Comics.com.  You may have missed one of our early bird specials, but our current prices are still an amazing deal!<BR><BR>

<A NAME="34"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Is your site secure?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

Yes, our Website is secure.  Your personal information is protected and we do not share any of your information with third parties unless required by law.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="35"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Can I pay with something other than a credit card?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

Currently we only accept credit or debit card via our secure Website.  However, we are investigating additional payment options, such as Paypal, which we hope to make available soon.  <BR><BR>

<A NAME="36"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Why does my account "automatically renew"?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

On the anniversary date of your subscription purchase, we will automatically renew your account and charge  your credit card so that your Comics Extra or Comics Extra Gold benefits will continue for a new subscription period. We do this for your convenience and so the service that you are currently receiving can continue without interruption.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="37"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: What if I don't want to renew at all?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

If you don't want to renew your subscription just send us an e-mail requesting cancellation of the automatic renewal of your account (please e-mail your request at least one week in advance of your expected renewal date). You can e-mail us at <A HREF=" mailto:cancellations@comicmembers.com">cancellations@comicmembers.com</A> and we'll process your request promptly.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="38"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Can I cancel and get a refund?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

We are committed to making sure our subscribers are satisfied with our product.  You may cancel your subscription completely and for any reason within 72 hours of your original purchase date and receive a full refund.  To cancel, you need to e-mail <A HREF=" mailto:cancellations@comicmembers.com">cancellations@comicmembers.com</A> with your request.   Cancellation requests received within this specified time period will be processed promptly.  Requests received after this time period will not be considered though, unless a valid technical issue limits or prohibits you from accessing your subscription.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="40"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Why do I have a $1.00 charge on my credit card?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

In some cases, when you submit your billing information your credit card is first charged $1.00 to test that the card is valid. This is a temporary charge that will automatically disappear from your account after a few days. If, for some reason, the $1.00 is not removed from your statement within 3-5 days, please contact us.<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="70"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: What if I want to extend my subscription or upgrade to a higher membership level?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

Whether you have a free Comic Basic membership or a premium membership package, you can upgrade your subscription to a higher membership level or to one of longer duration. You can do this at any time during your subscription period. All you have to do is go to your My Account page and choose to upgrade your account type.<BR>
<BR><BR>

<A NAME="71"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Why is the charge on my credit card lower than the full price of my subscription?</FONT></A><BR><BR>
All upgrade charges are pro-rated against your prior subscription payments. Thus, if you are already a Comics Extra or Comics Extra Gold member and decide to upgrade to a higher membership level, you will be charged less than the full subscription price. <BR>
<BR><BR>

<A NAME="72"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Can I pay for a subscription over the phone?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

No.  Unfortunately, the only way to pay for a subscription is online.  Our payment processor accepts any major credit card.  Your information will be transferred securely to them.  If you have any payment questions don't hesitate to contact us at <A href="mailto:customerservice@comicmembers.com">customerservice@comicmembers.com</A>.<BR>

<FONT CLASS="blue">Comics.com Website</FONT><BR><BR> 

<A NAME="41"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: I see the same strip every day. Why?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

Comic strips are updated daily. We admit, sometimes there is a glitch in our service and a new comic doesn't come up, but we try to fix it right away.  However, if this is something you experience frequently it may be because of the way some browsers and servers cache the images that they receive. It's possible that you are seeing a local copy again and again instead of getting the updated strip from our site. (Hopefully it's a really funny one...)<BR><BR>

We've done everything possible on our end to solve the problem for most users, but here are a few more things you can try:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Click on the strip itself to load just the daily strip onto your screen. 
<LI>Click on your reload button to get a fresh copy of everything on the screen. 
<LI>Clear your disk cache, then quit and restart your browser. 
<LI>Sing "America the Beautiful" while hopping up and down on one foot and juggling coffee beans... (just wanted to see if we could make you do it). 
</UL>

If none of these options works it is possible that you are working through a proxy server. If so, have someone connected with that system contact us at <A HREF="mailto:support@comicmembers.com">support@comicmembers.com</A>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="42"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: I keep seeing red X's instead of graphics. Why?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

Red X's or any other types of bizarre icons are a symptom of an overloaded server or line. Try clicking the "Images" button on your browser or the "Reload" button. That should fill in the missing pieces.  If it doesn't, please contact us at <A HREF="mailto:support@comicmembers.com">support@comicmembers.com</A>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="43"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: What's with all the advertisements on your e-mail and Web Site?  Can't you just get rid of them?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

It's a fact of life that without advertising and product sales, United Media would have no Web site. Currently, our ads are being handled by outside firms that rotate them from their sites, so we don't see the ads prior to their rotation on our pages. We do our best to monitor the advertisements to maintain an enjoyable user experience.  If you find an ad offensive in nature please contact us and we will have it removed.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="44"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: Do you sell comic-related products?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

United Media's <A HREF="http://www.cafepress.com/unitedmedia" TARGET="_new">online store</A> offers custom mugs, shirts, mouse pads and more from CafePress. You choose which artwork you want from a selection of comic strips and character illustrations, you decide what product you want, and the mug, shirt or whatever you choose is custom made especially for you.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="45"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: I really love a particular artist - How can I let him/her know?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

You can find contact information for a particular cartoonist in the "Contact the Artist" section of the strip's site.  Some artist prefer to get "snail mail" and others prefer e-mail.  The section will provide you with all the specifics you need.<BR><BR><BR>

<FONT CLASS="blue">Using United Media Comics</FONT><BR><BR>

<A NAME="46"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: I want a copy of a certain comic strip for my own personal use.  How do I get it?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

If you want a nice, clear, black and white copy of a strip, we can send you a photocopy of a clean press proof (cleaner than a newspaper copy) at regular newspaper size. These proofs cost $15. Each proof sheet contains a week's worth of daily strips (Monday through Saturday) or one Sunday strip.<BR><BR>

We also offer high-quality, black-and-white Photostats at full size (approximately 14" x 4" for a daily and 13" x 9" for a Sunday) suitable for framing. The cost is $50 for a daily strip and $75 for a Sunday strip. Please add $4 for shipping and handling, and $10 for international delivery.<BR><BR>

Original strips and signed copies of strips are unavailable. (Sorry!)<BR><BR>

Send a letter with a brief explanation on how you intend to use the strip and include the date (located on the strip) and a description of the strip.  If you can provide the wording in the first pane of the strip that would help get your request processed faster.  Please include as many details as possible when sending a description as many strips can be similarly described.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="51"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: My local newspaper doesn't publish my favorite comic strip.  How can I get it in the paper?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

If you'd like to see your favorite comic strip from comics.com added to your local newspaper, check your paper for a mailing address, phone number or e-mail address, and send a request to the Comics or Features Editor.  Editors want to create the best possible newspaper for their readers, so your input does make a difference!<BR><BR>

<A NAME="52"><FONT CLASS="strong">FAQ: I would like to submit my comic strip idea.  What should I do?</FONT></A><BR><BR>

We are always interested in new ideas, especially if they come from you - yes, you who are reading this right now - we think you have a lot of potential! To submit comic features to United Feature Syndicate and Newspaper Enterprise Association for possible syndication, keep reading for our submission guidelines. (If you are interested in submitting a column or text feature, <A HREF="http://www.unitedfeatures.com/ufs/submissions.html">click here</A> for writing guidelines.)<BR><BR>

<FONT CLASS="green">Sending Your Submission:</FONT><BR><BR>

We would like to see 18-24 samples of your work so that we can judge its consistency. It is fine to include color work if you care to, but be certain to include some black &amp; white line art as well. <BR><BR>

Please include a short cover letter about yourself and your work. Lengthy character descriptions, licensing prototypes and large presentations are unnecessary and make our job more difficult. Please do not send oversize materials.<BR><BR>

Submit photocopies or printouts on 8.5 x 11-inch paper. NEVER send original art. Never send anything that you must have returned.<BR><BR>

Your full name and return address should appear on both your envelope and on each sheet of art in your submission in case your work becomes separated from its envelope.

If you would like your submission returned, you must include a self-addressed stamped envelope (SASE). If you would like confirmation that your submission was received and reviewed, you must also include a SASE. If no SASE is included, we will respond only to submitters from whom we would like to see more material.<BR><BR>

Send your submission to: Comics Editor, United Feature Syndicate/Newspaper Enterprise Association, 200 Madison Ave., New York NY 10016. Addressing your package in any other way will delay the review of your work. <BR><BR>

It can often take three months to review a submission. If you have an e-mail address, please include that in your cover letter.<BR><BR>

We cannot grant appointments prior to seeing your work.<BR><BR>

We realize all this may be daunting and possibly even discouraging. It is not intended to be. Just as your creation is important to you, our time and the efficient, thorough review of your work is important to us. Following these guidelines will make it easier on everyone.<BR><BR>

The following tips may help you in the submission process:<BR><BR>

Work in whatever size you feel most comfortable. However, please take the time to measure the kind of feature you are submitting in your local newspaper and work in the same proportion.<BR><BR>

Your art needs to be clean and legible enough to reduce to newspaper size.<BR><BR>

Please do not call us asking what kind of paper or other tools to use. If you are not an artist, please look into taking a beginning art class or look for art instruction books in the library.<BR><BR>

Please do not spend a lot of money on your presentation. Expensive binders or special folders will not impress us. It is your work that concerns us.<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><FONT CLASS="strong">Answers to other frequently asked questions about submissions:</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT CLASS="strong">Q: How does syndication work?</FONT><BR><BR>

A: Syndicates promote, sell, edit, and distribute features (comics, editorial cartoons, puzzles, columns) to newspapers around the world. We also represent our features in a variety of subsidiary venues, such as publishing and licensed media or products. United Media is comprised of two syndicates, UFS and NEA. Although the two syndicates differ in the way they market to newspapers the features are handled by the same sales, editorial and licensing staff. Your contract would be with the individual syndicate, and you would be advised of the differences between the two ahead of time.<BR><BR>

<FONT CLASS="strong">Q: How much do cartoonists make?</FONT><BR><BR>

A: We pay our cartoonists using the standard syndication royalty split.<BR><BR>

<FONT CLASS="strong">Q: How many submissions do you get? How many become syndicated?</FONT><BR><BR>

A: We receive more than 4,000 submissions a year. While there is no set number of acceptances, we launch about two or three new comics each year.<BR><BR>

<FONT CLASS="strong">Q: Should I copyright my strip before I submit it?</FONT><BR><BR>

A: If you are worried about copyright ownership, please consult a lawyer. You might check your library or the Internet on this issue.<BR><BR>

<FONT CLASS="strong">Q: I've written a comic strip, but I'm not an artist. Can I still submit my work?</FONT><BR><BR>

A: Please find an artist interested in your idea and work together to submit it. Although many strips are collaborative efforts, we do not find artists for writers or vice versa.<BR><BR>

<FONT CLASS="strong">Q: I have an idea for one cartoon that I'd like you to buy. Can I send it to you?</FONT><BR><BR>

A: We do not buy "one-shots." We suggest you check "artist market" type books for publications that do.<BR><BR>
