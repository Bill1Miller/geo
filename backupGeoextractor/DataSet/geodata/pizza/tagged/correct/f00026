</font>

This page is for the Los Angeles County chapter of
the <a href="http://www.uuasc.org/">UNIX Users Association of Southern
California</a>. We welcome people who are interested in any and all
forms of UNIX. The primary focus of the group is our monthly
presentations, which are designed to hopefully improve technical knowledge,
rather than be just sales-type presentations.
<P>
Membership is <strong>FREE</strong>. Just come to a meeting, and sign
yourself up for the <a href="http://www.uuasc.org/general.html">(e)mailing list!</a>

Linux high performance clusters

David Kewley
</p>

<P>

<P>

Continuing on the extreme Linux theme that has brought us outstanding talks on
extreme performace tuning and extreme security, we will now close off with a
special program on extreme clusters.
<P>

At the August meeting of UUASC-LA, our own David Kewley who runs a 1024-node
Beowulf at Caltech will describe the structure, construction, and maintenance
of that high-end cluster.
<P>

David will introduce us to supercomputing, provide us with performance
statistics, explain what is "compute time", compute node management, and
monitoring.
<P>

David is a member of Caltech's Systems Management Service Unix team, serving
as the Beowulf's only admin.



<P>
NOTE: Please be prompt, as we plan to start at 7 pm <em>SHARP</em> !!

<P> 

<b>PIZZA</b>: We used to have a pizza order-taker. We dont any more.
Email Phil Brown if you want to volunteer taking over that duty.


<P>
 UUASC-LA believes no one should go hungry. If you require kosher,

<h3> Post meeting activities</h3>
Even if you eat pizza, you will still have room for dessert, so 
dont forget our  optional gathering at Coco's restaurant in the
Manhattan Beach mall, corner of Sepulveda and Marine Ave, for dinner and
chatting. (Drive south of the meeting building down Sepulveda, turn left
on Marine, and take an immediate left into the shopping area).
<P>
The chocolate cream pie is a particular point of interest ;-)

<h3> Directions to 
  <a href=http://suned.sun.com/US/locations/LOSA.html>Sun Microsystems, El
    Segundo</a></h3>

A big thank-you to Matt Ingenthron of <a href=http://www.sun.com/>Sun</a>, 
for providing us with our meeting place!
<pre>
<GEO TYPE="US">222 N. Sepulveda Blvd, Suite 1800, El Segundo, CA 90245</GEO>
<b>10th floor</b>, to the right of the elevators.
Use the elevators on the west side of the building

This is one of the huge white "Pacific Towers" buildings. The one with
"Oracle" on the top, funnily enough...

From the 105 freeway:
  Take the Sepulveda (aka hwy 1, aka airport) exit, but go SOUTH.
  It's about a kilometre down Sepulveda, on the left.
  Take a left just BEFORE the building, on Grand avenue, and turn
  into "Visitor Parking"

From the 405 freeway:
  Take the exit just south of the 105 (El Segundo Blvd)
  Go west for 2+ miles on El Segundo Blvd.

  Turn right onto Sepulveda Boulevard. Stay in the right lane and take
  another right onto Grand Avenue. Pass the building on the corner
  completely and turn into the second driveway on the right were it says
  "Visitor Parking."

Parking:
Parking in the adjacent structure appears to have cycled back to
non-free, for now.
