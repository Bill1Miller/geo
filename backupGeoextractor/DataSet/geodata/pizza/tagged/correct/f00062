         <BR>
         Thousands of tourists flock to the "City of Angels" each
         year. Often referred to as Los Angeles, this entertainment
         Mecca boasts something for everyone - young or old.<BR>
         <BR>
         Let's start with food. The streets of LA are lined with
         every kind of restaurant imaginable. For a quick bite and a
         small budget, you will find three great offerings. The best
         of which is In-N-Out. (No, this is not an adult novelty
         store, but the best burgers, fries and shakes in the
         business - hands down.) If In-N-Out doesn't strike your
         fancy, try Tommy's. Rolaids should be sold as an impulse buy
         at the counter of this chili-lover's haven. Still not
         tempted? Check out Jack in the Box, a West Coast phenomenon
         that offers a variety of treats - guaranteed to suit even
         the pickiest of eaters. These three restaurants can usually
         be found on any fast-food thoroughfare throughout the
         city.<BR>
         <BR>
         For a laid back and enjoyable lunch or dinner, try
         California Pizza Kitchen. CPK isn't just about pizza, it is
         the epitome of Cali-cuisine. Larger malls usually carry this
         franchise as an anchor restaurant. The Cheesecake Factory
         not only has a diverse menu with generous portions, but
         dozens of different kinds of cheesecake (save some room).
         The original restaurant is located directly off Rodeo drive
         and is a great place for star gazing. Two other locations
         include Marina Del Ray and Canoga Park. Looking for "locals
         only" hangouts? Pancho's in Manhattan Beach offers
         incredible Mexican food and great live entertainment on the
         weekends. King George's (yes, there are pubs in California)
         has the best fish and chips around and serves up a variety
         of imported brews. It is located near 3rd and Promenade in
         Santa Monica.<BR>
         <BR>
         In the market for Italian fare that is nothing less of
         bellisimo? Try Micelli's, situated just below the entrance
         to Universal Studios. Don't be surprised if you see your
         waiter belting out the tunes during his shift. The wait
         staff doubles as entertainment. Often times audience members
         can be found singing a tune in front of the microphone. No,
         this is not karaoke, many of the staff members are
         in-between actors using their natural talents to make a dime
         in the meantime. For a romantic twist, make reservations in
         one of the two cupolas overlooking the restaurant. Each
         seats only two and offers both ambiance and a view of the
         festivities.<BR>
         <BR>
         For the sports fan, LA truly has it all - except a team in
         the NFL, which is on the way. However, what LA is missing in
         professional football it easily makes up for in other
         professional sports. Two of the NBA's biggest names play in
         LA - the Clippers and the Lakers. The NHL has the Anaheim
         Ducks and the LA Kings. And baseball fans have their choice
         between the Anaheim Angels and LA Dodgers. Fans can easily
         pick up tickets at the game or call ahead to reserve seats.
         Or better yet, why not take advantage of technology and buy
         the tickets online?<BR>
         <BR>
         Since the weather in LA is generally never in question,
         outdoor activities should top a traveler's list. From
         people-watching to being watched, take your pick, but there
         is no place better on Earth to do it than the beach and
         Rodeo Drive. If being involved is your cup of tea, you can
         bike, skate, swim, jog, shoot hoops or try to earn a quick
         buck by showing off your talents - whether real or perceived
         - at Venice Beach. Favorites include palm reading, fire
         walking and eating glass. Lots of tree huggers and
         Volkswagen Bus residents can be found among the many
         tourists and locals that enjoy this weekend hangout.<BR>
         <BR>
         Santa Monica Beach is situated a few miles north. Rent a few
         bikes and ride up the coastline or take in the historic
         Santa Monica Pier, filled with shops, rides and games. For
         the window shoppers and star watchers, take a walk down
         Rodeo Drive. Take a peak in some of the extravagant shops
         where the prices will knock off your proverbial socks. A
         must-see for the first-time tourist!<BR>
         <BR>
         And lastly, let's wrap up our tour with some of my all-time
         favorites. The Universal Studios tour is like no other.
         You'll get a close-up view of your favorite movie sets and
         learn just how those cool special effects were created.
         Check for show listings and pick up tickets to live tapings
         of your favorite network sitcoms.<BR>
         <BR>
         Take a relaxing day cruise to Catalina Island, where you'll
         find a number of beaches, shopping areas and amusements. One
         cannot go wrong with Disneyland, nestled in nearby Anaheim,
         or Magic Mountain, in Saugus. Both amusement parks offer a
         delightful array of rides for the young and old.<BR>
         <BR>
         Enjoy a drive down historic Hollywood Boulevard and a walk
         around Mann's Chinese Theater to see footprints of the
         stars. At Starline Tours, next to Mann's, you can purchase a
         ticket for a bus tour of the stars' homes. The humorous,
         guided tour passes you by the homes of past- and present-day
         stars, including Marilyn Monroe and Cher.<BR>
         <BR>
         And finally, a right-of-passage for any LA tourist, pick up
         tickets for 'The Price is Right' or a taping of the 'Tonight
         Show.' Bob Barker and the showcase showdown can be yours by
         writing to: Price is Right, CBS Television City, <GEO TYPE="US">7800
         Beverly Boulevard, LA, CA, 90036</GEO>. Jay Leno and his bevy of
         guest stars tape the show at NBC Studios in Burbank. Find
         out the taping schedule and line up the morning of the show
         where tickets are handed out on a first-come, first-serve
         basis.<BR>
         <BR>
         In planning your LA visit, don't try to do everything in one
         week. Target specific activities, plan day trips and allow
         yourself some rest in between. Bring lots of sunscreen,
         spending money, film for the camera and your best tourist
         gear! Have a few extra days left over on the West Coast
         after all this excitement? Las Vegas is just a short
         four-hour drive away.<BR>
