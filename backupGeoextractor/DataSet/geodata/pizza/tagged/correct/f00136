><b>dorkbot-socal</b> is a monthly meeting of artists 
(sound/image/movement/whatever), designers, engineers, 
students and other interested parties from the southern california / los angeles area 
who 
are involved in the creation of electronic art (in the broadest sense of 
the 
term.)
<p>
the purpose of <b>dorkbot-socal</b> is to:

<ul>
<li>give artists/programmers/engineers an opportunity for informal peer 
review
<li>establish a forum for the presentation of new 
art works/technology/software/hardware
<li>help establish relationships and foster collaboration between people 
with various backgrounds and interests
<li>give us all a chance to see the cool things that our neighbors are 
working on
</ul>
<p>
imaginary presentation topics:
<p>

<ul>
<li>a demo of the new motion tracking software you're writing
<li>playing a video you made
<li>an explanation of how you hacked your game boy to get it to make cool 
bleeping noises
<li>trouble shooting/brainstorming your remote-controlled sandwich making 
robot
<li>bringing in some dancers you're working with and having them 
demonstrate 
the interface used in your new mind-control ballet
<li>discussing your approach to electronic sculpture

</ul>
demos of commercial software are not appropriate, unless you wrote the 
software or you are making it do something particularly novel or 
interesting. on the other hand, presenting a piece that was created using 
commercial software is fine.
<p>
<b>dorkbot-socal</b> meetings are free and open to the public. space at 
some 
events may be limited, so you are encouraged to rsvp to help us make 
adequate arrangements for each event. rsvp at: <a 
href="mailto:dorkbotsocal@dorkbot.org?subject=i am a 
dorkbot.">dorkbotsocal@dorkbot.org</a> <p>

<b>dorkbot-socal</b> meetings are largely informal, but to save everyone 
time and energy a certain amount of planning will go into each meeting. 
the current structure for presentation/demo events is:
<p>
<ul>
<li>brief intros, announcements, administrative details
<li>20 minute presentation followed by 10 minutes of q & a
<li>20 minute presentation followed by 10 minutes of q & a
<li>20 minute presentation followed by 10 minutes of q & a
<li>final comments/debate/etc.
</ul>

<p>
which means that each meeting is about 2 hours long and features three 
presentations.
<p>
on the other hand, "open hack" events will be more free-form:
just bring your stuff, work on it (or show it) and get feedback.<BR>

<p>
q: i want to present something at <b>dorkbot-socal</b>. is my project
appropriate? what styles/genres/scenes does <b>dorkbot-socal</b> 
represent?
<br>

a: <b>dorkbot-socal</b> is (or tries to be) totally neutral in regard to
style/genre/scene. an emphasis on the creative use of electricty is all 
that is required. see above for some examples of appropriate topics.
<p>
q: what if i just want an audience for my new piece?
<br>
a: short performances/demos are fine. however <b>dorkbot-socal</b> isn't 
really a
good venue for presenting things like full performances or long-form 
recorded
sound/video pieces. if there's enough interest we will probably organize
some more formal performances/shows at some point. for now the meetings
will be more informal chances to exchange ideas with other interested
parties.
<p>

q: i make cold, hard, intense, machine-robot-skull-hammer music, and am 
bent on the annihilation of the human species. can i participate in 
<b>dorkbot-socal</b> meetings?

<br>
a: yes, of course! however, you are not allowed to kill any people at a 
<b>dorkbot-socal</b> 
meeting.
<p>
q: i do soft, warm, dreamy, auto-electrolysis live performance video and 
founded a local PETA chapter. can i participate in <b>dorkbot-socal</b> 
meetings?
<br>
a: yes. 
<p>

q: do i have to join something to participate in <b>dorkbot-socal</b>?

<br>
a: no. although you might, at some point, be asked to contribute to the
pizza fund.
<p>
q: why are <b>dorkbot-socal</b> meetings on the one day in the month i'm 
busy? 
<br>

a: because.
<p>
q: well can you change the date? how about the first tuesday of the month?
<br>
a: probably not. this is southern california -- there are jammed freeways 
every day of every month filled with people that think they have somewhere 
important to go. if it 
turns out that the first x-day of the month is a truly horrible time 
for most of the people involved then we'll see about another time. but for 
now we're sticking with x-days, since we don't have a better 
alternative.<p>
q: is <b>dorkbot-socal</b> run by a university?

<br>
a: no. <b>dorkbot-socal</b> is run by the participants in 
<b>dorkbot-socal</b> 

and is coordinated by Garnet Hertz. the meetings are free and open to 
the public. the locations of our meetings have been kind  
enough to sponsor <b>dorkbot-socal</b> and to donate the use of their 
facilities. 
<p>
q: <b>dorkbot</b> is a stupid name.
<br>

a: i had nothing to do with this.  blame douglas repetto.
