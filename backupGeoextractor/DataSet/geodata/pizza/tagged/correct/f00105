					  <p align="left"><br>The  good news is that plastics recycling is increasing rapidly.  But there is one major challenge that remains. To assure proper processing at recycling facilities, plastic types must not be mixed. Yet it is extremely difficult  to tell one type from another by sight or touch. The plastics  industry has responded to this problem by developing a  series of symbols commonly seen on the bottom of plastic  containers. Place in your bin ONLY those types of plastic listed by your local waste hauler!</p>

bins at supermarkets should also be marked with the types and colors of plastic accepted. Commonly, Types 2 and 4 can be mixed, but not always. If your supermarket's bags or bins are not marked, please ask the store manager to do so.</p>

                      printer cartridges are easily recycled, refilled, or re-built. 
                      Some forward thinking companies, such as Hewlett-Packard, 
                      include a postage-paid return label with each cartridge 
                      so they may manufacture new cartridges out of used ones. 
                      Both laser and ink jet cartridges can also be refilled. 
                      Check search

                      recycled printer supplies.</p>
                    <p>As paper 
                      use in printers continues to increase, it is more important 
                      than ever to recycle. Setting up a paper recycling program 
                      at your work can help. Businesses should consider printers 
                      that seamlessly print on both sides of a sheet, termed "duplex printing." Individuals, 
                      especially those with home-based businesses, should also 
                      push for the manufacture of economical printers that print 
                      on both sides of a sheet.</p>
                    <p>Uniform, 
                      clean white paper from impact printers is among the most 
                      valuable types of recycled paper. Used laser printer paper is 
                      less valuable because of the melted plastic toner. Very 
                      high quality recycled paper for use in printers is readily 
                      available. Due to the finer grain of recycled paper, 
                      the print quality is often better than that of virgin paper.</p><a href="#top"><img src="images/art_arrow_up_b.gif" width="30" height="47" align="right" border="0" alt="Top of page"></a><br>
