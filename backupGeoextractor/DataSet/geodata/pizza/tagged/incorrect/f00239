	<div class="storycontent">
			<p>Thinking Outside the Box: Staff Writers in NWU?</p>
	<p>Mike Bradley</p>
	<p>Contract advisor, former National Grievance Officer, former SF<br />
Co-Chair</p>
	<p>Recently there have been discussions about the unthinkable - inviting<br />
staff writers to join the Writers Union. In the chapter and on NWU<br />
email lists, activists have proposed expanding our recruitment base to<br />
include employees, whether full-time, part-time or temp. As the<br />
discussion proceeded, I found myself more and more convinced that we<br />
should do it - officially open our membership to staff writers.</p>
	<p>For me, the key to enrolling staffers was to let go of preconceptions<br />
about what a union should be. I&#8217;m happy to let go of those<br />
preconceptions because, let&#8217;s face it, the traditional labor movement<br />
isn&#8217;t setting any houses afire, except maybe its own. Unions need to<br />
reinvent themselves, fast.</p>
	<p>I don&#8217;t think enrolling staffers means plunging into the typical<br />
collective bargaining mess. Instead, we can simply offer staffers the<br />
same benefits and opportunities that we offer freelancers. Nothing<br />
more. Nothing less.</p>
	<p>The union was founded by freelancers who felt they had no one to stick<br />
up for them, and sticking up for them would remain a core purpose. The<br />
genre programs would remain, the special projects like the offshoring<br />
campaign and the self-publishing kit, the contract advice, the health<br />
insurance. Maybe, someday, we&#8217;d organize collective bargaining<br />
contracts, but we certainly wouldn&#8217;t start out with that as our goal.</p>
	<p>Would a staff writer want to join the union? Sure. We already have<br />
numerous employees in our membership. Look around you at your next<br />
union event. You&#8217;ll see staff writers who also write articles and<br />
short stories; writing professionals who freelance for the extra<br />
income, career advancement, or just plain pleasure. These writers are<br />
generally indistinguishable from the full-time freelancers, so how<br />
different can their interests be? Of course, their employment contract<br />
is different from a freelancer&#8217;s, but in all other significant ways,<br />
it&#8217;s hard to see much difference. Why not end the fiction of<br />
separateness and open the door to their full membership?</p>
	<p>Wouldn&#8217;t we have to represent the staffers in their contract<br />
negotiations? What about grievances? Do we have the ability to handle<br />
staff grievances? We could provide staffers the same kind of contract<br />
help that we do now. When a contract advisor helps a freelancer<br />
negotiate a contract, she doesn&#8217;t do the bargaining herself, she only<br />
helps the writer bargain. Handling grievances would be more<br />
complicated - employment law is an awful tangle. So maybe we would only<br />
help staffers find the proper help for their grievances. But that&#8217;s<br />
more help than the labor movement gives them now, right, so why  not<br />
do it?</p>
	<p>The main objections that have been voiced are that enrolling staffers<br />
is more than we can handle right now, that we should succeed with<br />
freelancers before we expand to staffers, that staffers would embroil<br />
us in a very different union environment. I think you could also add a<br />
general uneasiness about losing our uniqueness. However, thinking<br />
outside the box means just the opposite-keeping our uniqueness and<br />
inviting more writers to enjoy it.</p>

	<div class="storycontent">
			<p><em>by Rick Knee</em></p>
	<p>California’s open-meetings and public-records laws are considered among the strongest in the country.<br />
<img class="fig_right" align="right" src="http://www.unionwriters.org/img/post/sca1.jpg" title="SCA 1: the public’s right to know" alt="SCA 1: the public’s right to know" /><br />
Proposition 59, which appears on the Nov. 2 ballot, would make them even stronger, by fixing into the state Constitution the principle of the public&#8217;s right to know.</p>
	<p>It’s not as strong as sunshine advocates would like. Most notably, it wouldn’t touch the legislature &#8211; not surprising, since it’s the legislature that’s putting the measure before the voters &#8211; and it wouldn’t weaken or eliminate any exemptions from current sunshine statutes. That’s why groups such as the League of California Cities finally signed onto it.</p>
	<p>Still, it represents an improvement over current open-government laws:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The legislature may not amend the state Constitution on its own. Under pressure from politicians and bureaucrats, the legislature has over the years eroded the sunshine statutes affecting the state and local governments.</li>
	<li>Constitutional law trumps statutory law. So while sunshine laws must be balanced with personal-privacy and other constitutional safeguards, Proposition 59 is intended to protect open-government laws from being discounted or ignored when sunshine-privacy conflicts arise.</li>
	<li>Under Proposition 59, courts and public agencies would have to give narrow interpretations to existing laws when barring citizens from official meetings or withholding certain government records.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Some localities &#8211; including San Francisco, Oakland, and Contra Costa and Los Angeles counties &#8211; have open-meetings and public-records laws stronger than the state’s. Most don’t, and San Francisco’s Sunshine Ordinance doesn’t touch the school or community college district (though the districts’ respective boards may adopt their own open-government guidelines within a few months).</p>
	<p>Proposition 59 has a long list of supporters including Gov. Schwarzenegger; the San Francisco Board of Supervisors; the Brisbane City Council; the Society of Professional Journalists; the National Writers Union, Bay Area Chapter 3; the California Labor Federation; San Francisco Labor/Neighbor; the San Diego-Imperial Counties Labor Council; the League of Women Voters; the Sierra Club; the San Francisco and Alameda County Green parties; the Peace &#038; Freedom Party; the San Fernando Valley Democratic Party; the California Independent Public Employees Legislative Council; the Communications Workers of America, Local 9423; and the Progressive Jewish Alliance.</p>
	<p>Newspapers endorsing Proposition 59 include the San Francisco Bay Guardian; the San Francisco Chronicle; the San Jose Mercury News; the Vacaville Reporter; the Sacramento Bee; the Santa Cruz Sentinel; the Los Angeles Times; and the San Diego Union-Tribune.</p>
	<p>Proposition 59 has no known organized opposition. In fact, the official ballot argument against the measure comes from a sunshine advocate, Mountain View attorney Gary B. Wesley, who says the initiative isn’t strong or far-reaching enough.</p>
	<p>We agree with Wesley&#8217;s contention, but Proposition 59 would still be a big step forward. It deserves your “yes” vote.</p>

			<p><em>By Don Monkerud</em></p>
	<p>Unable to find low-wage workers with around-the-clock availability, executives at the country&#8217;s largest pizza chains will begin outsourcing pizza delivery jobs to China and India beginning as early as next week. </p>
	<p><img class="fig_right" align="right" src="http://www.unionwriters.org/img/post/pizza_delivery.jpg" title="Pizza, Yum" alt="Pizza" />George Sotight, CEO of Strawmulch Pizza, will outsource 20,000 of his 30,000 pizza delivery jobs to India in a pilot project aimed at increasing shareholder profit. Strawmulch faces increased competition from McDonalds, which has bounced back from a recent slump in sales with aggressively priced Mad Cow Weekend specials. </p>
	<p>&#8220;We are seeking ways to squeeze more profit from our franchisees because, frankly, employees can&#8217;t survive on the wages we pay,&#8221; said Sotight. &#8220;We will concentrate on what we do best—producing profits for our shareholders who would never dream of eating at Strawmulch.&#8221; </p>
	<p>Sotight explained that there is a steady supply of recent college graduates in India who will work for low wages and are available to board a plane at a moment&#8217;s notice, deliver pizzas door-to-door in the US in 24-hour shifts, and then return to India. Planes are being furnished by Halliburton Pizza Delivery, which obtained a no-bid contract from the Pentagon to use standby military aircraft on Preemptive Strike duty at airbases around the world. </p>
	<p>&#8220;Unlike American workers who drive clunkers, our new Indian workers will deliver pizzas on bicycles,&#8221; said Sotight. </p>
	<p>Industry experts say India pizza delivery workers—the subcontinent&#8217;s equivalent of slave labor—can deliver up to six billion pizzas a year in the US. Strawmulch competitors, Playdough and Thinslice, are considering outsourcing to China and paying workers 25 cents a day. </p>
	<p>&#8220;Globalism means foreign employees who work for nothing and complacent voters who keep Republicans in Washington,&#8221; said Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who warned against &#8220;protectionism.&#8221; </p>
	<p>Despite losing over 2.2 million jobs under Bush, the economy is on a record pace to set new unemployment records not seen since the Great Depression. Greenspan predicted that the economy will strengthen in coming months as US forces are freed from Iraq to threaten rivals such as France and Germany. By increasing the size of the army and reclassifying fast-food restaurants as a &#8220;manufacturing industry,&#8221; the decline of manufacturing jobs can be mitigated. </p>
	<p>&#8220;History shows that the rich always get richer,&#8221; said Greenspan. &#8220;By making the tax cuts for the wealthy permanent and paying for them out of everyone&#8217;s Social Security, the rich will prosper even more.&#8221; </p>
	<p>Increasingly, US firms are outsourcing jobs to India and China. The latest plan, from Education Secretary Rodney Paige, would replace 2.7 million National Education Association members with teachers from China who don&#8217;t oppose Bush&#8217;s No Child Left Standing program. </p>
	<p>&#8220;We can no longer trust teachers,&#8221; said Paige. &#8220;These terrorists demand a living wage and the only way for us to be safe is to ship in teachers from China. By drastically reducing teachers&#8217; pay, we will have more money for occupation forces and tax cuts.&#8221; </p>
	<p>In an innovative twist, O.J. Simpson and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger last week announced that they are outsourcing the investigations of themselves to China. After investigating himself for killing his wife, Simpson is frustrated because US investigators have turned up nothing. </p>
	<p>&#8220;The killer may be in China,&#8221; Simpson told Fox newswoman Janet Lapdog. &#8220;They have more people and many more suspects.&#8221; </p>
	<p>Rob Shutmouth, Schwarzenegger&#8217;s spokesman, said that Californians have forgotten about the groping charges advanced during the Governor&#8217;s election campaign due to the Governor&#8217;s white skin and his great Republican connections. Schwarzenegger is considering holding the public forum for women to air their grievances, which he promised after his election, in China as well. </p>
	<p>Not to be outdone, President Bush fired the panel that was investigating the weapons of mass destruction brouhaha and outsourced it to China. Although some claim the move is a clumsy attempt to shield the president, Scott McFluffy, White House spokesman, denied that language barriers would prevent a clear airing of the issue. </p>
	<p>&#8220;Capitalism relentlessly moves to find lower wages,&#8221; said McFluffy. &#8220;If the President can benefit in any way from lower prices, he wants to take advantage of the American citizen to give them what they deserve.&#8221; </p>

			<p><em>by Randy Lyman (with no help from Marcel Proust)</em><img class="fig_right" align="right" src="http://www.unionwriters.org/img/post/lyman.jpg" title="Randy Lyman" alt="Randy Lyman" /></p>
	<p>First of all, I want to express my congratulations to all the <a href="http://www.working4writers.org" target="_blank">Working4Writers</a> candidates on their astounding landslide victory over the incumbant <a href="http://www.membersfirstforwriters.org/whyvoteforus.html" target="_blank">Members First</a> slate. In light of the news from the Delegates Assembly, I was one of the many who voted with their feet and let my membership lapse, though not without penning a protest note at the top of my X-ed out membership form before mailing it back.</p>
	<p>That said, the election results give me encouragement and new hope. I am confident that if anyone can reverse the NWU&#8217;s long slide into crisis, it is people like Jerry Colby, Al Weinrub, and the other W4W candidates. To be frank, part of me wants to take a &#8216;wait and see&#8217; attitude, to let them put their policies and programs into place first before I re-commit to anything; but another, wiser part understands that the programs won&#8217;t get into place without the participation of &#8216;rank and file&#8217; (what a wrong term to use for writers) members like myself who now may have reason to vote with our feet once more, in the opposite direction.</p>
	<p>Secondly, a big &#8216;thank you&#8217; to Jeffrey Perry for his <a href="http://www.yourunionnews.com/aucurant/1notaunion.htm" target="_blank">excellent expose</a> of the backstage subversions of ex-president Tasini and attorney Peterson. I was shocked but, given my experience on the National Oversight Committee in 2001, not surprised. Now that the DOL has ruled the NWU is not a labor union, I wonder how the NWU&#8217;s new leadership will get that designation reversed. I can&#8217;t imagine it will be easy, but I think it should be among the NWU&#8217;s first and highest priorities; otherwise, Tasini/Peterson will have caused the union irreparable damage that destroys its ability to accomplish anything else.</p>
	<p>Much has been written&#8212;in Perry&#8217;s article, in W4W campaign statements, in commentaries by various members on <a href="http://www.yourunionnews.com" target="_blank">Your Union News</a>&#8212;about the disaffection of long-time members. But there are also the new members and enthusiastic activists like myself who got their first taste of unionism in the NWU, only to learn quickly that the labor movement can be just as brutal and corrupt as the corporate-controlled media say it is. I (and others) expected more from writers.</p>
	<p>With the reputation of the Tasini-Menaker regime having tarnished the NWU throughout the writing world, how badly will this hinder the NWU&#8217;s organizing efforts&#8212;efforts that President-elect Colby has promised to make a priority? The arrogance and power-hunger of the outgoing regime (one can hardly term it &#8216;leadership&#8217;) has crippled the NWU, something it can ill afford as it struggles to gain members and revive itself as a primary and indispensable bulwark against the global corporate onslaught. How will the new organizing VPs encourage writers to reassert their role in the struggle? How will we undo the damage? What&#8217;s in all this to attract new members to the cause of writers in particular and labor in general?</p>
	<p>As for myself, the part of me that&#8217;s &#8216;waiting and seeing&#8217; is also asking how a revived union will address my changed writing life in an ever-changing publishing world: I&#8217;m now a staff writer/editor for another union (SEIU), my freelance efforts have shifted from journalism to poetry (&#8217;Poetry is news that stays news.&#8217; &#8211; Ezra Pound), and most significantly, this week&#8212;on the two-year anniversary of my OC resignation, as it happens&#8212;I officially inaugurated a self-publishing business (Fighting Words Press), something I would not have gained the knowledge or courage to do without the National Writers Union (specifically the Bay Area Local). The union helped me become a self-publisher; will its mission include support for me and other writers who have adopted this alternative to corporate publishing?</p>
	<p>That&#8217;s just one of the questions I&#8217;ll be asking myself and the union&#8217;s new leadership. Another one will be, &#8216;How much are dues?&#8217; I&#8217;ll also be remembering the camaraderie I&#8217;ve enjoyed with other members, our shared missions and goals, the networking and social events and opportunities for activism, and the feeling that&#8217;s perhaps most cherished by writers, of not being alone, but of belonging to something larger, something that the words from our pens and keyboards help create. I&#8217;d love to have all that back, and just as meaningfully, I&#8217;d like to find some new way to participate in it, one that reflects my new writing persona, in a union that wants to take advantage (in the positive sense) of my new skills and perspectives. The Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno wrote, &#8216;I believe. Lord aid my disbelief.&#8217; That captures my present feelings pretty well.</p>
	<p>Again, congratulations to the new NWU leadership (this time the term applies), and best of luck. I&#8217;ll be glad to meet you halfway.</p>
	<p>In solidarity,<br />

	<p><em>Randy Lyman was a member of the NWU&#8217;s National Oversight Committee during the Tasini election controversy of 2001, in which the Oversight Committee found that misuse of union resources by both the UAW and the incumbent Tasini administration had tainted the national election. This finding was nullified by the UAW when it directed that Tasini himself, and other officers who supported him, should rule on the legality of their own election.</em>

			<p><em>by Aahz</em></p>
	<p>One of the premises of the Bay Area Chapter&#8217;s Writer as Publisher seminar was that authors don&#8217;t need agents. That&#8217;s true as far as it goes: you don&#8217;t need an agent. Nevertheless, I have chosen to pay 15 percent of my writing income to an agent, and I&#8217;m here to tell you some reasons why an agent might be a good choice for you too.</p>
	<p>Let&#8217;s put it bluntly: I&#8217;m lazy. Obviously, I can&#8217;t be lazy in everything or I wouldn&#8217;t get any work done. But when there&#8217;s a chore that I dislike or can&#8217;t do particularly well, I prefer to pay someone else to do the work. Dealing with contracts and publishers is one chore that I&#8217;m glad to foist off on someone else.</p>
	<p>Keeping in mind that I recently signed my first book contract (for an intermediate-level book on the Python programming language), here are two basic services that my agent provided for me:</p>
	<p>My agent knew what I could negotiate for. I&#8217;m talking about both the financial aspects (where my agent negotiated a substantial increase above the initial offer), and the contract itself. Of course, I used the NWU Guide to Book Contracts to cross-check my agent, but sometimes the Guide focuses too much on what is desirable rather than obtainable. Plus, the Guide has little genre-specific information. For example, it pushes authors to keep the copyright-but I discovered that every single computer book on my shelves has copyright in the name of the publisher, and there is no way a first-time author can counter that.</p>
	<p>I could do research to get all this information myself, but my job is writing, and I&#8217;d rather focus on that than on the incidentals. From my point of view, it&#8217;s similar to using a car-buying service versus negotiating directly with a car dealer. Sure, you can probably get a better price negotiating directly, but it takes a lot of time, effort and stress.</p>
	<p>My agent acted as a buffer between the publisher and me. This is the most important use of an agent for me. I&#8217;m not the most tactful person, and I don&#8217;t particularly like negotiating. So knowing what I wanted, my agent translated my demands into more soothing language. A good example:</p>
	<p>My publisher wanted my book to have lots of illustrations, and sent a contract that required thirty-five illustrations (even though I don&#8217;t think the book lends itself to lots of illustrations). When I told my agent that this was a deal breaker (using exactly that wording), the publisher changed the language to &#8220;Author agrees to make his best efforts to provide illustrations for the Work where they are recommended by Publisher.&#8221; That was fine with me; I can draw decent illustrations as long as I know what I&#8217;m supposed to draw.</p>
	<p>In the future, I expect that my agent will also help me figure out which publishers would be receptive to my book pitches. Again, this is something I could research myself; but with fifteen or twenty computer book publishers, all constantly changing their requirements, it makes more sense to me to let an agent keep current on this type of information.</p>
	<p>To sum up, you don&#8217;t need an agent. But if you get filled with dread at the prospect of wasting your valuable writing time approaching publishers and negotiating contracts, hiring an agent might be the right move for you.</p>
