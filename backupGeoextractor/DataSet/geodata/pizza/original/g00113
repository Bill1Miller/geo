    world to know what residents of San Clemente have known for almost 20 years. Ask anyone in
    town where to go for great Italian food, and they&#146;ll tell you Sonny&#146;s Pizza
    &amp; Pasta. Known simply as Sonny&#146;s, this charming and quaint restaurant is the
    local hot spot. Sonny&#146;s is located on El Camino Real, the main thoroughfare of the
    Spanish Village By The Sea. Most nights, as you drive by, you&#146;ll see a crowd forming
    in the front of the restaurant. There is usually a short wait, but people don&#146;t seem
    to mind. It&#146;s a great place to socialize on the outdoor patio and enjoy a cold beer
    or a nice glass of wine. You will always meet interesting people at Sonny&#146;s.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What is it that makes Sonny&#146;s so successful? Sonny is a true hands-on owner. Every
    morning, he comes in early to prepare the sauces, all his own original recipes. Most
    nights he can be seen in the kitchen preparing authentic Italian pizza and pasta.
    Sonny&#146;s is a family run restaurant, with Sonny in the kitchen, and his daughter Julie
    running the front of the house. Julie speaks with pride of her father&#146;s hard work.
    She attributes the restaurant&#146;s success to her father&#146;s commitment to being
    there seven days a week to cook and make sure things run right.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This sense of family pride transfers to the employees. The entire staff offers quick,
    professional service. The authentic Italian food is served with a touch of Southern
    California as you can dine on an open air patio, served by the beautiful Sonny&#146;s
    Girls. Chef Tom Olsen has been a mainstay on the lunch shift for many years now, and is
    proud of the compliments the restaurant receives from the public and food critics alike.
    Elmer Dills, food critic for KABC television in Los Angeles, gives Sonny&#146;s rave
    reviews.</font></p>

    <img align="left" border="0" src="/images/2474tble.gif" alt="Authentic Italian Food, Made From Scratch Everyday - San Clemente, Ca." width="180" height="180"></a> The food
    is superb and affordable. Many specials are offered, and most nights have a special theme.
    For example, Monday night is the ever popular Spaghetti Night, where you receive a
    generous portion of spaghetti and an order of garlic bread for $4.99. Add a salad for only
    a dollar more. An extensive wine list is available to complement your meal. Sonny&#146;s
    also offers food to go and catering for parties, weddings, and meetings. Fax or call for a
    catering menu.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The family is heavily involved in the community, sponsoring fundraising dinners and
    donating to most charities in town. It is their way of saying thanks and giving back to
    the community. Sonny, a big sports fan, is proud to sponsor his own men&#146;s softball
    team, consistently among the best in town. Check out the on-line menu, then stop in and
    see what everyone&#146;s talking about. Mention Sonny&#146;s Web-site and be treated to
    something special!</font></p>
