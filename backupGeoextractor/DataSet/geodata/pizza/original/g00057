Organic ingredients from the Hollywood Farmers' Market will be used. This event raises funds to send our convivium's delegate, Grady Atkins, to Terra Madre 2006. All funds raised will go directly towards delegate travel expenses.</p>

<p>Five types of pizza will be prepared: <br />
++ Classic Margarita<br />
++ Spinach, Crimini Mushroom, and Organic Pork Sausage<br />
++ Grilled Eggplant and Wild Mushroom<br />
++ Charred Rapini, Roasted Garlic, and Ricotta<br />
++ Smoked Salmon with Red Onion and Dill Creme Fraiche. </p>

<p>About Terra Madre:<br />
Terra Madre brings together farmers and food producers, food communities, cooks, and scholars from more than 130 countries. The 2006 event will take place in Turin, Italy at the same time as the Salon de Gusto. Delegates will share knowledge and explore the three elements that make up the world of food: the traditional and practical knowledge of producers, and the experience and creativity of cooks, and the insight of science and research.</p>

<p>Slow Food International provides transportation and housing for delegates while in Italy. The local convivium is expected to raise funds for airfare. In addition, each convivium has been asked to support a delegate from Latin America. More information about Terra Madre 2006 can be found at <a href="http://www.terramadre2006.org/terramadre/welcome_eng.lasso" target="new">http://www.terramadre2006.org/terramadre/welcome_eng.lasso</a>. </p>
