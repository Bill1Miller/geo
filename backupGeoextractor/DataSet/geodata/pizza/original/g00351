       SIZE="+1">When we lived in Tuscaloosa,</FONT></B> and the only
      pizza available was from chains, we used to drive to Birmingham
      to have New York Pizza. Since we've lived in Birmingham for seven
      years, however, we have discovered other wonderful pizza parlors,
      and it's been a while since we've been to this Edgewood favorite.</P>

      <P>The stretch of Oxmoor where New York Pizza is located is a
      haven of small, casual, local restaurants, where you can get
      Italian, barbecue, and Mediterranean food.</P>

      <P>The place has a slightly old, well-worn, almost run-down look,
      which if you've been in some of the ubiquitous pizza joints in
      New York will make you feel right at home. All it needs is some
      stairs. The inside had been painted since we were last there,
      a dark blue similar to the color of the awning that is over the
      preparation/oven area. The lower part of the walls is paneled
      and red, white and blue lights ran all along the top edge of
      the paneling. Above the door is a television and a window air
      conditioning unit that lost its front grille years ago. (This
      place is a bit warm in the summer.) There are a lot of utilitarian
      tables and chairs crammed close together, and a couple of ancient
      picnic tables covered with carved named and initials. New York
      posters adorn the walls. Eighties music was playing courtesy
      of &quot;The Point&quot; 106.9 radio. There are a few video games
      in the back of the restaurant, as well as the restrooms, which
      were not too clean.</P>

      <P>We sat down at a table near one wall, and were soon greeted
      by a friendly, perky waitress in a New York Pizza T-shirt. It
      took us a while to decide what to order, but she checked back
      frequently without being annoying.</P>

      <P>A sign on the door noted that wine and gourmet ingredients
      were now available. Most of the items on the menu are given names
      of New York locations, such as the Broadway Calzone, the Brooklyn
      Italian sub, and the Little Italy pizza.</P>

      <P>There is also a World Trade Center pizza, loaded with traditional
      meat and vegetable toppings, plus extra dough and extra cheese.
      Our waitress told us that in the weeks following the Sept. 11
      attacks, the restaurant was donating part of the proceeds from
      the sale of this pizza to charities for the victims of the attacks.
      A large mirrored skyline of the pre-Sept. 11 New York City skyline
      decorated the wall above our table, with yellow ribbons and a
      small American flag adorning the Trade Center towers.</P>

      <P>We started out with a house salad ($2.25), a black plastic
      bowl full of crisp iceberg lettuce, a generous serving of tomatoes,
      and thinly sliced fresh mushrooms served with crackers. We had
      the House Italian dressing, a delicious homemade vinaigrette.
      Other salads available include an antipasto salad, Greek salad
      and pasta salad. If you want to start with an appetizer other
      than salad, you can get eggplant rollitini, garlic bread, garlic
      cheese bread, or cheese toast.</P>

      <P>We had to get our favorite pizza, the Statue of Liberty ($11.45
      for a 12-inch), with pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, onions
      and green peppers. The sausage is flavorful and spicy without
      being overwhelming. The tomato sauce is sweet yet zippy, and
      there was plenty of it. All the toppings were very fresh-tasting
      and there was a generous amount. There was plenty of cheese,
      but not so much as to overwhelm the other flavors. The crust
      was fairly thin and crispy, although thicker than most pizza
      we've had in New York. It was baked in real pizza ovens, not
      those conveyor/hot-air excuses for ovens you see at many chains
      now. In the past we've had the large, 16-inch size, and it has
      tended to be a bit soggy in the middle. We suspect that's because
      of the size, and will definitely order smaller pizzas in the
      future.</P>

      <P>There are 10 different specialty pizzas you can order, including
      four vegetarian options and unusual combinations such as the
      Buffalo, N.Y., pizza (chicken, onions, banana peppers, cheddar,
      mozzarella, and spicy Buffalo win sauce with blue cheese dressing
      on the side). The new toppings are used in gourmet pizzas such
      as the Southampton (pesto sauce, artichoke hearts, sun-dried
      tomatoes, onions, feta, parmesan and mozzarella). Of course,
      you can create your own pizza with the choice of 10 meats, 15
      vegetables and four kinds of cheese.</P>

      <P>The only thing we've had in the past has been pizza, so we
      decided to try a sub sandwich, as well. We settled on the Soho
      Sausage sub ($4.95), described on the menu as &quot;Italian sausage
      and provolone cheese smothered in onions, green peppers, jalapenos,
      mustard and olive oil dressing.&quot; The sandwich arrived in
      a paper-lined red plastic basket, covered with rippled potato
      chips. A good-sized portion of smashed-flat Italian sausage was
      served on about a 6-inch soft white toasted hoagie roll. Unfortunately,
      it was hardly what you would call &quot;smothered.&quot; There
      were about four slices of jalapeno peppers, and a few slivers
      of onions and green peppers. The mustard and olive oil dressing
      was tasty, as was the sausage, but it would have been a whole
      lot better with more onions and peppers. They could take some
      lessons from Mike Zaden at Chicago Mike's on how to smother a
      sandwich in onions.</P>

      <P>To drink we passed on the newly available house wines and
      had a bottle of Rolling Rock, served in a cold plastic mug ($2.50),
      and water, served in a huge plastic tumbler. There are eight
      kinds of beer available in bottles, plus non-alcoholic Heineken,
      and Bud or Bud Light on tap.</P>

      <P>Other sandwiches include a Long Island Vegie, Wall Street
      Meat Ball and Queens Turkey. There are also two calzones and
      two kinds of lasagne, classic and vegetarian. New York cheesecake,
      Midnight Ecstasy chocolate cake, key lime pie and French silk
      pie are available for dessert, but we didn't have any room.</P>

      <P>If we rated New York Pizza on its pizza alone, it would definitely
      get three forks. But a disappointing sandwich and unpleasant
      restrooms drop the score to two and a half - above average, and
      worth going, but it could be better.</P>
