          <td>
<p>
Patterns of land use and available transportation systems play a critical

role in determining the economic vitality, livability, and sustainability

of urban areas.  Transportation interacts with land use, and both have

significant environmental effects, in particular on emissions, resource

consumption, and conversion of rural to urban land.  Decisions concerning

land use and transportation are frequently contentious; further, the

long-term consequences of decisions may not be apparent at the time they

are being made.  Strong technical support may help foster informed

deliberation on these issues.  Toward this goal, we have been developing

UrbanSim, an open-source, reusable modeling system.  Our purpose is to

provide a tool for citizens' groups, urban planners, elected officials, 
and

others to help predict future patterns of urban development and impact

under different possible scenarios over periods of 20 or more years.  It

has been applied in a number of regions world-wide, including Puget Sound.

In the talk, I'll give an overview of UrbanSim.  I'll then spend the bulk

of the time on one particular aspect of the system, namely, the design of

the user interactions around the system, in particular the use of

indicators to distill the results of the simulation in ways that are 
useful

and speak to what is important to the different stakeholders.  Both the

modeling work, and its presentation using indicators, interact with such

values as fairness, transparency, and support for democratic deliberation.

To approach these issues in a principled fashion, we have been using the

Value Sensitive Design theory and methodology; and I will also talk about

Value Sensitive Design and how we have been using it in the project.

Alan Borning is Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at 
University

of Washington in Seattle, and also Adjunct Professor in the Information

School and co-director of the Center for Urban Simulation and Policy

Analysis.  His current research interests are in human-computer 
interaction

and designing for human values, particularly as applied to land use,

transportation, and environmental modeling.  He has also done work in

constraint-based languages and systems, other aspects of human-computer

interaction, and in object-oriented programming.  He received a Ph.D. from

Stanford University in 1979, and is a Fellow of the Association for

Computing Machinery.

<B>From South Seattle/SeaTac Airport via I-5:</b><BR>
* Follow I-5 North all the way through downtown Seattle (DO NOT take the 
Express lanes).<br> 
* After you pass the exit for Hwy 520, take EXIT # 169 to NE 45th St. & NE 
50th St.<br> 
* Stay RIGHT on the off-ramp for NE 45th St., but then quickly MOVE TO THE 
LEFT-HAND lanes in order to turn left on NE 45th St. at the light.<br> 
* Turn LEFT onto NE 45th St. and cross over the freeway, heading West on 
NE 45th St. for about a mile (about 8 traffic lights, just after Olympia 
Pizza).<br> 
* Turn LEFT onto Stone Way and head South about 10 blocks.<br> 
* Go STRAIGHT through the light at NE 34th St. and then take the very NEXT 
RIGHT onto Northlake Way.<br> 
* After a couple of blocks, the road will narrow and make a slight turn to 
the left as you come up to a STOP sign. 
* There are two buildings in front of you, the meeting presentation is 
being held in the building on the right, furthest from the water, with the 
brick and gold exterior.<br> 
* GO STRAIGHT through the stop sign (past the ramp up to the right) and 
then take a quick RIGHT into the "701 Visitor Parking" area (small sign). 
Park in one of the numbered spots. If this is full there is some 
off-street parking available as well as commercial parking lots close 
by.<br>
* There are no real obvious and visible Adobe signs on the buildings so 
instead look for the big brick and metal buildings and the PS SIGCHI 
signage posted about to guide you to the meeting room.<br> 
* If you get lost, you can call Adobe for directions at 206.675-7000. The 
address is 801 N. 34th Street Seattle, WA 98103.
<p>

<B>From the Eastside (Bellevue/Redmond):</B><BR>
