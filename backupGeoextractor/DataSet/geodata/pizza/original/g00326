<div id="box2"><p><span class="titles"><id="a000609">Pala, Lower East Side</span><br>
      July 23, 2006 </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63334078@N00/196028237/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/62/196028237_e8264cdd0a_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Pala Pizza NYC" border ="0" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom:5px;" align="right"/></a> I stumbled on to Pala by sheer accident. It was a late Saturday night and Allen was buzzing with outdoor conversations, bottles of wine being uncorked and cabs screeching to a collective halt. My girlfriend and I were famished and headed into the open-air restaurant to grab a slice on the run. </p>

<p>We certainly didn't expect to fall madly in love. Although Pala was packed the gills, one never felt claustrophobic as the structure is much like a garage, with fresh air, open space and tables flowing out to the sidewalk. Each table is adorned with sprigs of fresh oregano (for pizza topping) and the menu is bountiful (40 Italian wines, over a dozen unique pizzas). We started off with the spinach salad - which was to die for - a plate filled with organic greens, fresh blue cheese and browned walnuts. Next up was the zucca pizza (pumpkin and top-notch pancetta) for me and the spicy cherry tomatoes and chunks of fresh mozzarella for my friend. The menu was filled with delish antipasti, salads and pizzas - so decision making was trying.</p>

<p>Be prepared the pizzas are HUGE! For $8, you get a foot-long, thin crust pizza that can easily feed two. With attentive service, remarkable and green conscious food (organic dough and ingredients), Pala boasts a chic, comfortable vibe and good with great flavor.</p>

<p><b>Tip</b>: Akin to Rome, pizza is served by the foot (a steal at $8) and easily feeds two. If you're in a hurry, you can order up pre-made slices at the counter. Also, CASH ONLY.</p>

<div id="box2"><p><span class="titles"><id="a000610">Naidre's, Park Slope, Brooklyn</span><br>
      July 23, 2006 </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63334078@N00/196210072/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/77/196210072_22c295da56_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Naidre's Park Slope" border ="0" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom:5px;" align="right"/></a> Hankering for walnut brownies, overstuffed ciabatta sandwiches, homemade granola, piping-hot peanut butter cookies without all the yuppified Park Slope attitude? My home base for long conversations and tasty fare has been Naidre's, a sweet cafe that escapes the stroller-mom madness of bustling Park Slope. </p>

<p>Inside resembles your breakfast nook replete with cookie jars, coffee pots, handwritten signs and the latest issues of <i>Seed, Business Week, Entrepreneur, O</i> and <i>Time Out New York</i>, spread out amongst the tables. Service is quick and incredibly friendly and you can tell a little bit of love goes into everything they make. From fresh tuna melts on multi-grain bread to the cinnamon raisin organic home-made oatmeal that sells out in a flash, to a bevy of healthy and decadent sandwiches, the options are bountiful and the vibe decidedly laid-back.  </p>

<p>If the sumptuous selection of baked goods (some vegan, sugar and gluten-free but all are divine) don't lure you back, check out their no cell phone policy - imagine a quiet lunch without someone barking into their phone.  There is no table turn policy here and I've spent afternoon hours munching on energy cookies (think granola, cranberries and all the healthy bits rolled into a fortifying treat) and sipping on raspberry ice-teas. The coffee is always strong and fresh, and tea selections delightful (black current, mango, english breakfast, and a variety of green teas).</p>

<p>So head in with the breakfast crowd for fresh food on the go or kick back in the later hours at this Park Slope down-home cafe.</p>

<div id="box2"><p><span class="titles"><id="a000571">Sugar Sweet Sunshine, LES</span><br>
      May  7, 2006 </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63334078@N00/141909052/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/50/141909052_4765a342bd_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="Sugar Sweet Sunshine" border ="0" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom:5px;" align="right"/></a> Owners Peggy & Debbie, former theater actors who ran in the corporate circuit and former employees of the famed Magnolia bakery, took their love of baking and launched a full-scale operation in Manhattan's Lower East Side. Armed with dusty Betty Crocker cookbooks, quite simply, the two best friends wanted to open a cozy, comfortable shop brimming with velvet and decorative treats. Your home - only with a pantry of cupcakes. In 2002, Sugar Sweet Sunshine was born.</p>

<p>SSS is a kitch place with a low-key vibe. The decor borrows from the 60's & 70's with pea-green chairs, tv dinner tables and other accessories of the playful era. But the cupcakes are a pure delight. Pistachio nut, pumpkin, and rich velvet pipped with either chocolate or vanilla icing, I guarantee you will enter giddy and leave with a dizzing sugar-high. And with haute bakeries hocking tiny, bland cupcakes priced upwards of $3-$4, these darling and creatively made treats at SSS are a worthwhile steal at $1.50</p>

<div id="box2"><p><span class="titles"><id="a000560">priti organic spa, East Village</span><br>
      April  9, 2006 </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63334078@N00/123692658/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/36/123692658_210baa696c_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="priti organic spa" border ="0" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom:5px;" align="right"/></a> Dying to get the celebrity spa treatment without the haute spa attitude? Tired of being shamed if your feet and bikini line are not up to snuff?  Itching to be beautiful without harming our world and ourselves? Well, the environmentally-minded girl on the run can take a long, sweet pause at priti, an organic, non-toxic spa.</p>

<p>I try to avoid spas as much as humanely possible. From getting a hard-sale twenty-minute product pitch while flutes whistle in the background of my allegedly relaxing facial, to snickers at my non-perfectly coifed bikini line, to being herded between treatments like cattle, New York City spa visits have become akin to expensive Chinese torture. Until I discovered priti - a snug haven in the midst of the heavily trafficked, hip East Village. Owner and former fashion model/fashion photographer Kim D'Amato's vision is simple: to support purveyors of organic products and to reduce chemically produced products, which are harmful to the environment, not to mention ourselves.</p>

<p>My kind of woman, and my kind of spa.</p>

Although the food is served in a rapid-flash style, there is nothing "fast food" about the chewy homemade pita, the outrageous falafel, the deliciously seasoned red onion and the shawarma - juicy and roasting on a revolving spit. </p>

<p>For $3.50, score a sandwich overstuffed with fresh food that's high on flavor. And the scene is certainly not greasy or low-budget - copper counters, Moroccan starlight fixtures, even a lounge! - Chickpea is the perfect moniker for this tasty wallet-conscious spot.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63334078@N00/108242714/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/54/108242714_709ee2f491_m.jpg" width="240" height="221" alt="Agnes B, Union Square" border ="0" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom:5px;" align="right"/></a> Ladies, I confess - I am addicted to chic, well-tailored clothing. Cigarette pants, a car coat, and daring red ballet flats? I'm seduced. For over twenty-five years, Agnes B, a French designer who must be channeling Audrey Hepburn as a muse for her elegant but not conventional fashions, has charmed her way into our closets.</p>

<p>The designer is inspired by everyday life, and is convinced that clothes are truly an expression of one's character. And upon entering their lovely and spare Union Square location, Miss B is right on the mark. The style is distinctly classic with a twist - a pleated skirt with a bullfight silkscreen, a fitted collar shirt with daring green stripes, a simple black cardigan with white polka dots decorating the lapel - the clothes are fun, wearable and not overly self-conscious. The palate is simple: blacks, whites, browns and navys. The coats are camel-haired and single-breasted black wool - all made with the finest quality materials, all flattering.</p>

<p>The store atmosphere is subdued and you won't find aggressive salespeople making a hard-sell in the dressing room. Instead you'll be greeted by jazz, French rap, and an eclectic mix of international books, cds, and tasteful, Parisian-style clothing.</p>

It's apropos that Lyle has restored this superb 1920's grand space, as the feel is decidedly a throw-back to the Algonquin set with its wood-paneled walls, antique fixtures, and dashes of vibrant red, <i>everywhere</i>.  A vintage skylight that was uncovered and refurbished by the owners holds court in the dining room amongst locals feasting on oysters, steamed mussels, and perfectly-seasoned roasted chicken with lemon and thyme. </p>

<p>The menu is elegant and fish-friendly, and also ideal for the veggie-conscious diner (delicious fresh roasted beets with tarragon, arugula salad), but what makes patrons swivel in their seats are the frites, cooked to perfection. </p>

<p>A fine selection of French and Italian vintage wines and a cafe menu that offers American comfort food favorites, makes this the eatery you wouldn't mind having around your corner.</p>

Go in for the baker's dozen at City Bakery, the iconic cafeteria-style shop that sells delicious sweets and decadent treats - a must-have for the gal with the sweet tooth. </p>

<p>Although the decor inside is industrial, and the arrangement of the cafeteria sort with metal chairs, tables and the lunchroom line, don't be deceived. Peer over the glass at warm pretzel croissants, piping hot chocolate (I dare you to drink the entire cup) and marshmallows for dunking, and enormous chocolate-chocolate chunk, oatmeal raisin, or black chocolate cookies. Prepare for the sugar rush, ladies, and be ready to indulge. </p>

<p>If you're serious about your chocolate addiction, go the distance in the curtained off connoisseur's room, where you'll find bars of Dutch and Belgium treats, cocoa, and other savory delights. The fine variety will make your head spin.</p>

<p>And yes, this gourmet emporium offers healthy items with a salad bar that can't be beat, lunches and brunches and other waist-conscious what-nots. But why would you want a chef's salad or buffet-style fare, when buttery cookies await? </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63334078@N00/107568321/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/47/107568321_6780bcb64c_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="Happy Ending Lounge" border ="0" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom:5px;" align="right"/></a> Voted "Best New Bar/Lounge" by Time Out New York, this saucy brothel-turned-bar heats up the revitalized "Loho" (Lower Houston) lounge scene. You may just miss it with its non descript entryway with a hot pink awning that reads "health club", but those in the know have just spied the hippest downtown lounge.</p>

<p>But once inside, lounge in set-in red velvet banquettes on street level, where you always feel like a VIP, or descend to the DJ-ready basement, where the original steam rooms have been renovated as tiled booths hosting private parties. The almost naughty feel harkens back to a 70's New York where it was the last days of disco and anything could happen below the Bowery. </p>

<p>The patrons are mostly fashionistas who haunt the nearby trendy Chinatown shops, however, a bevy of bi-weekly reading series has drawn the smart art kids. The now-infamous Happy Ending Reading Series (2 Wednesdays per month) hosted by the charming author, Amanda Stern, showcases emerging authors and musicians, who are all required to take a public risk during their performance. Village Voice columnist, Rachel Kramer Bussel's new In the Flesh Reading series, evokes nostalgia for this former massage parlor, where a happy ending, rather than decadent cocktails, was on the menu.</p>

      February 26, 2006 </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63334078@N00/104606956/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/40/104606956_37d87d7827_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="192 Books" border ="0" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom:5px;" align="right"/></a> We're privileged, we book-loving New Yorkers, and we don't even know it. As dedicated readers and writers, rarely do we experience a dearth of the corporate-dominated meccas as well as the slew of mom and pop shops that dot all areas of the city. If you're looking for a book and you have to be in New York, odds are you will find it. You will find signed first editions, perhaps the dog-eared author's copy, pen marks canvassing the insides. You want your foamy chai latte and a whole floor to devour the latest cookbooks, trash magazines, and plan that possible trip to Peru - then visit the closes Barnes and Nobles. No worries, they're careful to be within a mile radius of one another. </p>

<p>However, if your palate is a touch more discriminating, visit 192 books. Owner, Jack MacRae, is practically an institution in the New York literary and arts scene. This is a man who knew everyone and always dishes great stories. The bookstores featuring key works of literature and history, art and criticism, the social and natural sciences, travel and children's books, and more - you could tell all the books on the shelves and tables were chosen with particular and refined care. Careful to ensure that all the books, works of part, connect and disconnect in some interesting and pivotal way.</p>

<p>In addition to regularly presenting art exhibitions accompanied by a selection of titles relating to the artists or the theme explored, the store hosts reservation-only reading/speaking engagements with the world's eminent authors: Veronica Gaitskill, Salman Rushdie, Joan Didion, Paul Auster, Paula Fox, just to name a few. </p>

<p>192 Books operates purely for the aficionado. Dig up those hard-to-find books on the obscure German artist you love, purchase the definitive book on New York architecture, and with a knowledgable staff, they'll have find a new author to fall in love with.</p>

      February 23, 2006 </p>

		<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/31/47221927_205e2550f3_m.jpg" border ="0" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom:5px;" align="right"/> At Grounded on Jane Street, a sun-drenched cafe hidden on the side streets of Greenwich Village, I was greeted by swirling ceiling fans and free wireless internet connectivity - crucial for the freelance writer in need of a quick java fix. Decidedly non-Starbucks, which has evolved to the Duane Reade of over-priced coffee shops, Grounded has a distinct downtown flavor, as single folks, buried in their laptop, indulging on oatmeal cookies and luscious mochas, quietly occupy each table. Cell phones are on low buzz, and all the accoutrements of the corporate set - vanished. </p>

<p>Grounded is the ideal spot for those who want to mellow out or get work done. Finish that screenplay, put the finishing touches on the novel, or launch a new business - this office is certainly wallet-friendly.</p>

<p>With a fine selection or organic teas (raves for the blackberry and jasmine, both which were sampled by yours truly) and the yummy biscotti, plus some delicious, heady ground organic coffee, this is my new favorite haunt for sipping and sampling newspapers. Most of the sandwiches and sweets are organic and natural as well.</p>

This teeny haven serves up a smattering (150+) of organic, free-trade, and luscious mix-brewed teas in teapots from the dainty to the Orient. Don't be deceived by the softly-lit wire lamps, serene pink walls, and the display cases filled with whimsical china cups, sterling silver tea strainers, and aficionado books - owner, Jodi Holiday, stocks up whimsy alongside a rock and roll edge (from the tattoos to the Page and Plant blaring from the stereo).  </p>

<p>But the teas are nothing short of divine. Holiday serves up the classic mainstays: earl grey, english breakfast, however, she's creative, much like an obsessed French perfumier, creating new blends such as a Provencal blend of black teas and lavender. Customers have a choice of kettle teas, healing teas (infused with date, ginger citron or quince) or their famous honey/green tea lattes.</p>

<p>While the majority of their teas are from China, Sri Lanka, Japan, India, Indonesia, Taiwan, and emerging Rwanda, Kettle also offer herbs from South Africa, Argentina, Turkey, Iran, Egypt, France and the United States (including ginseng from Wisconsin and organic peppermint from Oregon). </p>

<p>So if you're interested in proper tea with an edge, visit this favored East Village haunt where the teas and homemade treats (palmiers, scones) never fall short on flavor.</p>

Amidst soothing jazz, you'll hear a constant buzz from patrons clicking on laptop keys or the family of tourists seeking refuge from the maddening galleries and street artists that flank West Broadway.  Akin to the sidewalk cafes and bistros in Paris, you're not gently prodded to the door as soon as you've polished off your goat cheese and portobello sandwich. Table-turn is an evil word at Once Upon a Tart and on a chilly Saturday afternoon, I met an old friend for hot tea, delicious treats and good conversation. During the three hours we spent in the cafe, I sampled the pumpkin cranberry biscotti AND scone, the roasted turkey and cranberry mango chutney and frisee sandwich, and a selection of their British teas, and couldn't have been more satisfied. Wonderfully seasoned with a care for presentation, my late lunch was not only savory but sweet and flavorful. The freshest ingredients are used here and the proof is definitely in the tasty fare.  The baked goods were heavenly - biscotti, light, crispy and the scone unbelievably light and flaky. </p>

<p>Whether you're jetting in for a quick pumpkin cranberry biscotti or spending a lazy afternoon sipping green tea and indulging in fluffy, decadent scones or being very, very good with a savory sandwich and tossed salad, Once Upon a Tart brings a little bit of whimsy into downtown bohemia. </p>

      January 16, 2006 </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63334078@N00/87404108/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/41/87404108_9b76371cda_o.jpg" width="135" height="160" alt="DiFara Pizza" border ="0" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom:5px;" align="right" /></a> Make no mistake, for good pizza, this girl will travel. Three trains and 45 minutes no less, but enter the non-descript DiFara Pizza on Avenue J, and after sampling the fare, the goods are certainly worth that wait. Amidst the bakeries, kosher delicatessens and laundromats that line this predominately Orthodox Jewish section of Brooklyn, in a small space you'll find Dominick DeMarco, dressed in comfortable shoes and his flour-dusted apron, making thin Neapolitan pies the same way he's been doing it for over forty years. </p>

<p>What sets DiFara apart from the legions of other pizzerias about town? DeMarco uses only the freshest and finest ingredients, buffalo and fresh mozzarella cheeses imported from Italy and after a few moments of watching him coax the dough, handle the pie in conspicuously non-wood-burning oven, no doubt you are in the house of a perfectionist. An artisan that serves up a wafer-thin crust, bits of fresh basil (grown in the window), and a lacing of extra-virgin olive oil through the sweet tomato sauce. The unveiling of the pie gets a ceremonial dusting of grana padana, administered in slow, deliberate, old-world style by the master himself. </p>

<p><b>Tip</b>: Bring a book, folks. DiFara tends to make them in, with fans traveling as far as the West Coast to indulge in rustic, down-home pizza. </p>

      January 15, 2006 </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63334078@N00/86868100/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/41/86868100_1833b214df_m.jpg" width="240" height="186" alt="Slice: The Perfect Food" border ="0" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom:5px;" align="right"/></a> Imagine for a moment the perfect pizza. A thin, flaky crust. Piping hot mozzarella cheese and savory toppings like sausage, homemade basil pesto, creamy mushrooms. Now imagine this pizza is healthy. You heard right - a pizza that's actually good for you. </p>

<p>Featured on the Food Network's show, "Recipe for Success", twenty-something owner, Miki, a self-diagnosed lactose intolerant, couldn't find delicious, guilt-free pizza that could be eaten anywhere. Seeking to make the ultimate American comfort food with the freshest, organic ingredients while giving customers the option to substitute traditional cheeses for rice/soy, coupled with an entrepreneur spirit - Slice was born. </p>

<p>It's cozy space in Manhattan's Upper East Side is clean, minimalist in decor and you're greeted with soothing, indie music and spoken word. The tasty menu is penned on a chalkboard and the options are enough to make your mouth water, no doubt. I sampled the "Novice" - sundried tomatoes, pesto, organic mozzarella on an unbleached, herbed crust. That was just the beginning of my meal. Fresh, wholesome salads, homemade, gluten-free and chocolately desserts, I left without the heartburn from all the grease and oil that is the staple of traditional pizza joints that clutter the city streets. And although the slices are on the pricey side ($4), the portions are fair and the outcome incredibly delicious. Who knew healthy could taste so darn good? </p>

<p>Slices and pies range from "Dunce" to "Genius," becoming more expensive as you get educated - $3.50 a slice/$18 a pie for a bruschetta-like "Dunce" to $24 for a "Master." (A build-your-own "Genius" pie starts at $20, and toppings are additional.)</p>
