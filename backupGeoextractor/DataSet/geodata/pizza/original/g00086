<br>
To: CCNMA&#8217;s Los Angeles chapter members<br>
<br>
From: Efrain Hernandez Jr., immediate past president<br>
<br>
Hello everyone:<br>
<br>
I hope all is well. Here&#8217;s the latest regarding the L.A. chapter and
CCNMA statewide.<br>
<br>
First, I&#8217;d like to announce that the L.A. chapter has a new president
in <span style="font-weight: bold;">RACHEL URANGA</span>, a reporter
for the Daily News of Los Angeles. Rachel will hold the post at least
through the end of this year, when the chapter holds elections. She may
be reached at 818-713-3741 or rachel.uranga@dailynews.com. As many of
you know, I served as chapter president for the past nine years. I&#8217;m
proud to say that during that time the chapter went from having no
funds and a dormant checking account to the more than $10,000 available
now for scholarships and special events. I remain on the CCNMA board as
an at-large member and treasurer.<br>
<br>
Second, we invite each of you to join us in celebrating the many career
accomplishments of longtime Los Angeles Times journalist and CCNMA
member <span style="font-weight: bold;">FRANK SOTOMAYOR</span>, who is
moving on after 35 years at the newspaper. Please join us on T<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">hursday, April 6, from 6 p.m.</span> until
whenever, at El Paseo Inn, 11 Olvera Street, Los Angeles. We&#8217;ll toast
Frank&#8217;s many years as an editor, mentor, coach, and activist in the
ongoing efforts to diversify America&#8217;s newsrooms. We&#8217;re going with a no
host/cash bar for this event. <br>
<br>
Other upcoming events of note include:<br>
<br>
CCNMA&#8217;s 26th annual Scholarship Banquet on Friday, June 2, at the
Millennium Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.<br>
<br>
The 5th annual CCNMA Golf Tournament presented by Anheuser Busch Inc.
and featuring the Henry Alfaro Media Team Challenge for Best Media
Outlet. This year&#8217;s tournament is scheduled Friday, August 25, at the
Brookside Golf Course, 1133 N. Rosemont in Pasadena.<br>
<br>
Don&#8217;t forget to plan for the annual Journalism Opportunities Conference
at the Millenium Biltmore Hotel in October.<br>
<br>
For more information about any CCNMA events please contact Julio Moran,
executive director, at 213-437-4408 or juliomoran@ccnma.org.<br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dear CCNMA members: </font><br>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Happy New Year! Best wishes to all. </font><br>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Los Angeles chapter, in an ongoing
effort to generate more member participation, has held free writing
workshops during the past several months. The next workshop, which will
focus on screenwriting and television writing, is scheduled Saturday,
January 22, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Los Angeles Times. For the
first time, CCNMA&#8217;s L.A. chapter is sponsoring the workshop in
partnership with the Asian American Journalists Assn. and the Black
Journalists Assn. of Southern California. The scheduled panelists
include Robert Lopez, a screenwriter and Times staff writer; Ron
Taylor, vice president for diversity development for Fox Broadcasting
Company and 20th Century Fox TV Studios; Pang-Ni Landrum, who has
written for &#8220;Malcolm in the Middle,&#8221; Sharon D. Johnson, who has written
for the Fox, ABC and UPN networks; and Keith Sharon, an Orange County
Register reporter whose first screenplay was &#8220;Showtime,&#8221; starring
Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy. The panelists will talk about their
experiences, the need for a more diverse talent pool and how
journalists can cross over into this industry.&nbsp;</font><span
 class="431130918-10012005"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></span><br>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Please RSVP for the free writers&#8217;
workshop by January 20 to Yvette Cabrera at<u> </u><a
 href="mailto:ycabrera@ocregister.com"><u><font color="#0000ff">ycabrera@ocregister.com</font></u></a>
or 714-796-2490. The Times&#8217; security requires a complete list of
attendees prior to the event. Those attending the workshop should enter
the Times at the 145 Spring Street lobby and go to the nearby community
room. Free parking is available at the Times lot on Spring Street
between Second and Third streets. </font><br>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In other business, the chapter must
again elect officers. I realize you are busy people with limited spare
time. I have not received notice of anyone who is eager to take on any
of the traditional offices (president, vice president, treasurer and
secretary). I am willing to continue as president and fill the other
roles as necessary if the membership feels comfortable with that
option. For your information, the chapter&#8217;s financial account holds
more than $8,000. We&#8217;ve been building that account for years so that we
can eventually take on more ambitious projects. Thanks to all of you
who pay your dues and make other contributions. Occasionally we dip
into the account to pay for food or other expenses during our free
activities. Our system of checks and balances involves CCNMA Executive
Director Julio Moran monitoring all our account activity, including
receiving bank statements directly from Bank of America. In other
words, I&#8217;m not the only one looking at our finances. Enclosed you&#8217;ll
find an election ballot. Please feel free to write in candidates or at
minimum confirm your approval of me as president. Mail your ballots
back to CCNMA asap at the new state headquarters: CCNMA, USC Annenberg
School of Journalism, 300 S. Grand Ave., Suite 3950, Los Angeles, CA
90071-8110.&nbsp;</font><span class="431130918-10012005"><font
