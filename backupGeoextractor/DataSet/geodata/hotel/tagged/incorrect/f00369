DESCRIPTIONS OF TUTORIALS

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorial 1A

Software Systems and Tools for High Performance Distributed Computing
Anand Tripathi, University of Minnesota

The  objective  of  this  tutorial  is  to  present  an
overview  of  the  mechanisms and software tools/systems that are
currently available for high-performance distributed  programming
in   local-area   networks.    A   high  performance  distributed
programming  environment  needs  mechanisms  for  specifying  and
managing   parallel   computation  structures  of  a  distributed
application, transparent distribution of  load  in  the  network,
dynamic  linking of components, error detection and recovery, and
transparency  of  the  hardware/software  heterogeneity  in   the
network.   This  tutorial  will  present  an overview of the most
commonly used paradigms and  models  for  distributed  computing.

These  are  related  to interprocess communication models such as
message  passing   and   the   remote   procedure   call   (RPC),
heterogeneous  computing, load balancing and scheduling of tasks,
and  naming   and  protection  of  resources  in   the   network.
Reliability related issues in implementing RPC will be discussed.
An overview the object model of computing will  be  presented  in
the   context   of  micro-kernel  architectures  for  distributed
computing. The concept of  group  is  a  useful  abstraction  for
managing  a  collection  of  related  activities.  Primitives for
group management and  broadcast communication will be  presented.
A   number  of  software  tools  and  programming  languages  are
currently   available   for    high    performance    distributed
programming.    An   overview   of   the   salient  features  and
capabilities of Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM),  Linda,  Express,
P4,  CODE/ROPE,  Mentat,  CC++, PCN, Jade, Orca, Concurrent C, SR
will be presented.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorial 1B

Interfacing to High Speed Networks: Adapter Design and Operating System Issues

K. K. Ramakrishnan, Digital Equipment Corporation

Overview: We have seen significant increases in the bandwidth available
for computer communication networks in the recent past. 
Commercially available Local Area
Networks operate at 100 Mbits/sec and research networks are running at greater
than 1 Gbit/sec. Host CPU processing speed has also increased relentlessly.
However, the anticipation that end-user applications can effectively use these
large communication link speeds has yet to be fulfilled to a large extent.
Network I/O at the end-system has often been perceived as the bottleneck for
distributed applications.  This tutorial discusses
the important topics in the design of a high-speed network adapter,
including the memory-system architecture, buffer management,
support for Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees
and flow/congestion control, and host software issues.
Several case studies will be presented.

Speaker: K. K.  Ramakrishnan is a Consulting Engineer
in the Distributed Systems Architecture and Performance group
at Digital Equipment Corporation. 
He has been with Digital since 1983 after completing
his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland. 
His group is involved in architecting Digital's efforts in the networking and
distributed systems area.  
Dr. Ramakrishnan has worked and published papers in the areas of load
balancing, congestion control and avoidance, algorithms for FDDI, distributed
systems performance and issues relating to network I/O. Dr. Ramakrishnan
participates in the Internet Engineering Task Force and is a member of the
End-End Group, as part of the Internet Research Task Force. He is also
a technical editor for IEEE Network. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorial 2A

Message Passing Using MPI: from Fundamentals to Applications

David W. Walker, Oak Ridge National Laboratory

This tutorial will describe the features of the MPI message passing
standard, and will show how to use MPI in applications. The tutorial is 
intended to benefit researchers who have some experience with message passing,
and who wish to assess the advantages of MPI for their particular applications.
However, the tutorial will be structured to also be of use to novices.
   The tutorial will be divided into three main parts. The first part will
give an overview of MPI, describe how it came about, and will discuss the
basic point-to-point and collective communication capabilities of MPI. The
second part will describe advanced features in MPI, in particular, the
management of groups and communication contexts. The third part will be
devoted to the presentation of application kernels and examples written
using MPI.

SPEAKER: David Walker is a Research Staff Member in the
Mathematical Sciences Section  at Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
and an Adjunct Associate Professor in the 
Department of Computer Science of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 
He obtained his B.A. in Mathematics from Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1973, 
his M.S. in Astrophysics in 1979, and his Ph.D. in Physics from the University
of London in 1983. From 1986-88. Dr. Walker was a member of the research staff
of the Concurrent Computation Project at the California Institute of 
Technology, and from 1988-1990 was an Associate Professor in the Department of
Mathematics at the University of South Carolina. He was worked at ORNL since 
1990, where he is mainly involved in the design of software libraries, 
algorithms, and application for distributed memory concurrent computers.
Dr. Walker was instrumental in establishing the MPI Forum, which led to the 
specification of the MPI standard and in which he played an active role.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorial 2B

High Performance Distributed Computing in a Supercomputing Environment:
Computational Services and Applications Issues

W. T. C. Kramer and Horst D. Simon, NASA Ames Research Center

The focus of this tutorial will be a discussion of current
hardware and software trends for massively parallel supercomputers
>from the perspective of applications. In case studies
the lessons learned at NASA Ames will be presented. The main thrust of
the tutorial will be a presentation of high performance computing topics
which will remain relevant for a long period of time, independent
of currently ``hot" machines. This requires a detailed investigation of
the issue of communication. From an applications perspective
the communication characteristics of various applications will be examined.
A new taxonomy of parallel application will be developed.
Similarly high-performance architectures will be investigated
with respect to their communications performance. The matching
of the applications taxonomy with the architectural characteristics
of a machine will form the basis for the understanding of high
performance computing. High performance distributed computing will thus
be evaluated as one possible alternative to both MPP and PVP systems.
Emphasis will be placed on an honest evaluation of the capabilities
and challenges that distributed computing faces in a production
environment.  The tutorial utilizes the unique experience made
at the NAS facility at NASA Ames Research Center.
Over the last five years at NAS 
massively parallel supercomputers such as the  Connection Machines
CM-2 and CM-5 from Thinking Machines Corporation
and the iPSC/860 (Touchstone Gamma Machine) and Paragon Machines
>from Intel were used in a production supercomputer center alongside
traditional vector supercomputers such as the Cray Y-MP and C90.
In addition to these resources, NAS has operated since 1993 a
distributed computing testbed (DCT), consisting of an environment 
with 50 SGI and 40 SUN workstations. 

Speakers:    William Kramer is Chief of the NAS Computational
Service Branch, and is responsible for providing state-of-the-art support
and enhancement of a Cray YMP, two C-90s, CM-5, an Intel iPSC/860, an Intel
Paragon and several Convex systems, along with over 250 other systems and
workstations connected via Ultranet, FDDI and ethernet.  These systems are
used by a nationwide network of over 1400 researchers in 100+ sites,
connected with the advanced NAS Aeronet and other networks.  Bill was
responsible for the first production Cray-2 and YMP at NAS before
becoming Branch Chief.  He is currently leading the NAS effort in
computing on loosely clustered workstations.  He has authored or
presented papers sessions and seminars on a number of subjects, 
including system management, computer graphics, security and supporting
advanced users at supercomputer centers.
He and his staff presented the highest rated Tutorial at Supercomputing 89,
"System Management in the UNIX Supercomputing Environment", which was presented
again by invitation at SC '90.

Horst D. Simon  is with Computer Sciences Corporation at
the Applied Research Branch at the
NAS (National Aerodynamics Simulator) Systems Division 
at NASA Ames Research Center in 
Moffett Field, California. He is CSC department manager and 
responsible for a group of researchers in the areas
of parallel algorithm development and scientific visualization,
who as contractor personnel collaborate with the NAS
staff. His research interests are in the development
of high performance algorithms for vector and
parallel machines. Particular areas of
interest are sparse matrix algorithms, algorithms for
large scale eigenvalue problems, and domain decomposition
algorithms for irregular domains for parallel processing.
Simon's algorithm research efforts were honored
with the 1988 Gordon Bell Award for parallel processing research.
Previously, until October 1989, 
Dr. Simon was an employee of Boeing Computer Services, and
>from October 1987 through October 1989, supported the NAS
project in a similar capacity. 
>From 1982 to 1983 Dr. Simon was an assistant professor at the Department of 
Applied Mathematics, SUNY Stony Brook, New York.  
Dr. Simon holds a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of
California (1982), Berkeley and a Diplom in Mathematik from the
TU Berlin, Germany (1978). 
Dr. Simon has presented tutorials on high performance computing
at all previous Supercomputing conferences. His tutorials 
have consistently been rated excellent or very good.

DESCRIPTIONS OF TUTORIALS

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorial 1A

Software Systems and Tools for High Performance Distributed Computing
Anand Tripathi, University of Minnesota

The  objective  of  this  tutorial  is  to  present  an
overview  of  the  mechanisms and software tools/systems that are
currently available for high-performance distributed  programming
in   local-area   networks.    A   high  performance  distributed
programming  environment  needs  mechanisms  for  specifying  and
managing   parallel   computation  structures  of  a  distributed
application, transparent distribution of  load  in  the  network,
dynamic  linking of components, error detection and recovery, and
transparency  of  the  hardware/software  heterogeneity  in   the
network.   This  tutorial  will  present  an overview of the most
commonly used paradigms and  models  for  distributed  computing.

These  are  related  to interprocess communication models such as
message  passing   and   the   remote   procedure   call   (RPC),
heterogeneous  computing, load balancing and scheduling of tasks,
and  naming   and  protection  of  resources  in   the   network.
Reliability related issues in implementing RPC will be discussed.
An overview the object model of computing will  be  presented  in
the   context   of  micro-kernel  architectures  for  distributed
computing. The concept of  group  is  a  useful  abstraction  for
managing  a  collection  of  related  activities.  Primitives for
group management and  broadcast communication will be  presented.
A   number  of  software  tools  and  programming  languages  are
currently   available   for    high    performance    distributed
programming.    An   overview   of   the   salient  features  and
capabilities of Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM),  Linda,  Express,
P4,  CODE/ROPE,  Mentat,  CC++, PCN, Jade, Orca, Concurrent C, SR
will be presented.

SPEAKER: Anand Tripathi is an Associate Professor in the Department
of Computer Science,  University  of  Minnesota,  Minneapolis.  He
received  the  B.Tech  degree  from  the  Indian   Institute   of
Technology,  Bombay,  India, 1972, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees
from the  University  of  Texas  at  Austin  in  1978  and  1980,
respectively,  in  Electrical  Engineering.  From 1972 to 1975 he
worked as a research scientist at Bhabha Atomic Research  Center,
Bombay,  India.   During  1981  to  1984  he  worked  as a Senior
Principal  Research  Scientist  at  Honeywell  Computer  Sciences
Center,  Bloomington,  MN.  At the University of Minnesota he has
led the design and development of the Nexus distributed operating
system  and  its programming environment.  His research interests
include  parallel  and   distributed   systems,   object-oriented
programming,  and  fault-tolerant  computing.  In the past he has
presented tutorials on distributed computing systems at  some  of
the IEEE sponsored conferences and tutorial-weeks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorial 1B

Interfacing to High Speed Networks: Adapter Design and Operating System Issues

K. K. Ramakrishnan, Digital Equipment Corporation

Overview: We have seen significant increases in the bandwidth available
for computer communication networks in the recent past.
Commercially available Local Area
Networks operate at 100 Mbits/sec and research networks are running at greater
than 1 Gbit/sec. Host CPU processing speed has also increased relentlessly.
However, the anticipation that end-user applications can effectively use these
large communication link speeds has yet to be fulfilled to a large extent.
Network I/O at the end-system has often been perceived as the bottleneck for
distributed applications.  This tutorial discusses
the important topics in the design of a high-speed network adapter,
including the memory-system architecture, buffer management,
support for Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees
and flow/congestion control, and host software issues.
Several case studies will be presented.

Speaker: K. K.  Ramakrishnan is a Consulting Engineer
in the Distributed Systems Architecture and Performance group
at Digital Equipment Corporation.
He has been with Digital since 1983 after completing
his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland.
His group is involved in architecting Digital's efforts in the networking and
distributed systems area.
Dr. Ramakrishnan has worked and published papers in the areas of load
balancing, congestion control and avoidance, algorithms for FDDI, distributed
systems performance and issues relating to network I/O. Dr. Ramakrishnan
participates in the Internet Engineering Task Force and is a member of the
End-End Group, as part of the Internet Research Task Force. He is also
a technical editor for IEEE Network.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorial 2A

Message Passing Using MPI: from Fundamentals to Applications

David W. Walker, Oak Ridge National Laboratory

This tutorial will describe the features of the MPI message passing
standard, and will show how to use MPI in applications. The tutorial is
intended to benefit researchers who have some experience with message passing,
and who wish to assess the advantages of MPI for their particular applications.
However, the tutorial will be structured to also be of use to novices.
   The tutorial will be divided into three main parts. The first part will
give an overview of MPI, describe how it came about, and will discuss the
basic point-to-point and collective communication capabilities of MPI. The
second part will describe advanced features in MPI, in particular, the
management of groups and communication contexts. The third part will be
devoted to the presentation of application kernels and examples written
using MPI.

SPEAKER: David Walker is a Research Staff Member in the
Mathematical Sciences Section  at Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
and an Adjunct Associate Professor in the
Department of Computer Science of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
He obtained his B.A. in Mathematics from Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1973,
his M.S. in Astrophysics in 1979, and his Ph.D. in Physics from the University
of London in 1983. From 1986-88. Dr. Walker was a member of the research staff
of the Concurrent Computation Project at the California Institute of
Technology, and from 1988-1990 was an Associate Professor in the Department of
Mathematics at the University of South Carolina. He was worked at ORNL since
1990, where he is mainly involved in the design of software libraries,
algorithms, and application for distributed memory concurrent computers.
Dr. Walker was instrumental in establishing the MPI Forum, which led to the
specification of the MPI standard and in which he played an active role.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorial 2B

High Performance Distributed Computing in a Supercomputing Environment:
Computational Services and Applications Issues

W. T. C. Kramer and Horst D. Simon, NASA Ames Research Center

The focus of this tutorial will be a discussion of current
hardware and software trends for massively parallel supercomputers
from the perspective of applications. In case studies
the lessons learned at NASA Ames will be presented. The main thrust of
the tutorial will be a presentation of high performance computing topics
which will remain relevant for a long period of time, independent
of currently ``hot" machines. This requires a detailed investigation of
the issue of communication. From an applications perspective
the communication characteristics of various applications will be examined.
A new taxonomy of parallel application will be developed.
Similarly high-performance architectures will be investigated
with respect to their communications performance. The matching
of the applications taxonomy with the architectural characteristics
of a machine will form the basis for the understanding of high
performance computing. High performance distributed computing will thus
be evaluated as one possible alternative to both MPP and PVP systems.
Emphasis will be placed on an honest evaluation of the capabilities
and challenges that distributed computing faces in a production
environment.  The tutorial utilizes the unique experience made
at the NAS facility at NASA Ames Research Center.
Over the last five years at NAS
massively parallel supercomputers such as the  Connection Machines
CM-2 and CM-5 from Thinking Machines Corporation
and the iPSC/860 (Touchstone Gamma Machine) and Paragon Machines
from Intel were used in a production supercomputer center alongside
traditional vector supercomputers such as the Cray Y-MP and C90.
In addition to these resources, NAS has operated since 1993 a
distributed computing testbed (DCT), consisting of an environment
with 50 SGI and 40 SUN workstations.

Speakers:    William Kramer is Chief of the NAS Computational
Service Branch, and is responsible for providing state-of-the-art support
and enhancement of a Cray YMP, two C-90s, CM-5, an Intel iPSC/860, an Intel
Paragon and several Convex systems, along with over 250 other systems and
workstations connected via Ultranet, FDDI and ethernet.  These systems are
used by a nationwide network of over 1400 researchers in 100+ sites,
connected with the advanced NAS Aeronet and other networks.  Bill was
responsible for the first production Cray-2 and YMP at NAS before
becoming Branch Chief.  He is currently leading the NAS effort in
computing on loosely clustered workstations.  He has authored or
presented papers sessions and seminars on a number of subjects,
including system management, computer graphics, security and supporting
advanced users at supercomputer centers.
He and his staff presented the highest rated Tutorial at Supercomputing 89,
"System Management in the UNIX Supercomputing Environment", which was presented
again by invitation at SC '90.

Horst D. Simon  is with Computer Sciences Corporation at
the Applied Research Branch at the
NAS (National Aerodynamics Simulator) Systems Division
at NASA Ames Research Center in
Moffett Field, California. He is CSC department manager and
responsible for a group of researchers in the areas
of parallel algorithm development and scientific visualization,
who as contractor personnel collaborate with the NAS
staff. His research interests are in the development
of high performance algorithms for vector and
parallel machines. Particular areas of
interest are sparse matrix algorithms, algorithms for
large scale eigenvalue problems, and domain decomposition
algorithms for irregular domains for parallel processing.
Simon's algorithm research efforts were honored
with the 1988 Gordon Bell Award for parallel processing research.
Previously, until October 1989,
Dr. Simon was an employee of Boeing Computer Services, and
from October 1987 through October 1989, supported the NAS
project in a similar capacity.
From 1982 to 1983 Dr. Simon was an assistant professor at the Department of
Applied Mathematics, SUNY Stony Brook, New York.
Dr. Simon holds a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of
California (1982), Berkeley and a Diplom in Mathematik from the
TU Berlin, Germany (1978).
Dr. Simon has presented tutorials on high performance computing
at all previous Supercomputing conferences. His tutorials
have consistently been rated excellent or very good.

        		CONFERENCE LOCATION

HPDC-3 will be held at the Westin St. Francis Hotel
in downtown San Francisco, California.  Just 30 minutes from the airport,
the Westin St. Francis is in the heart of the city
on Union Square surrounded by fine restaurants, shops and theaters.  Cable cars
stop at the front door.   The hotel is within walking
distance  of San Francisco's Chinatown and an easy cable car ride
away from Ghiradelli Square and Fisherman's Wharf.  Napa and Sonoma
Valleys, the heart of California wine country, are an hour's drive
away.  If you have additional time before or after the symposium you may
want to explore Marin County's redwoods, the California Mission,
or drive scenic highway 101 to San Simeon.
Monterey, Carmel, Santa Cruz, Yosemite National Park and Lake
Tahoe are not far away.

Weather: San Francisco in August is typically very pleasant.  Sunny
    and warm (about 70F) during the day, and cool (about 50F) in the
    evenings.  Note that the evening fog often makes it feel a bit
    colder and  a lightweight jacket or all-weather coat is advised.

Transportation: The hotel is about 20 minutes away from San Francisco
    International Airport.  A taxi ride from the airport typically costs
    about $25.  Also, the SFO Airporter has direct service to the
    hotel at 20-minute intervals.  The fare is $10 one-way and $17
    round-trip.

Rental Cars: HERTZ has been appointed as the car rental supplier for
    HPDC-3.  Special rates with unlimited mileage have been offered
    to HPDC-3 attendees and are also available the week prior and the
    week after the symposium.  To make reservations call HERTZ
    at 1-800-654-2240 (In Canada 1-800-263-0600) and identify yourself as
    HPDC attendee (Meeting # 15329).  Cars can be rented at most Bay-area
    airports and also at the Westin St. Francis Hotel.

Social Event: An evening dinner-cruise on the San Francisco Bay is planned
    for Wednesday, August 3.  The cost of the cruise is included in
    the registration fee.  Additional tickets may be purchased at a price
    of $55 each.

E-mail service will be available at the hotel to the attendees.
