    <p><strong><font size="+1">Hotel Reservation Deadline: Wednesday, January 14, 2004</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Location</strong><br>
      This  hotel is located at the world-famous Fisherman's Wharf, with
        easy access to Pier 39, the Cannery, Harbor Cruises and Ghirardelli Square.
        It is also across from the Powell and Mason Cable Car Line, and about
        a mile from Union Square, the Financial District and Nob Hill.</p>
    <p>Your support in staying at the <strong>Hyatt Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf</strong> helps
      keep the conference costs down, which directly affects you. SIAM guarantees
      the hotel that we will fill a certain number of &#8220;room nights&#8221; (rooms
      per night) during the conference. SIAM incurs penalties if too many attendees
      opt to stay in other hotels in the area or neglect to indicate to the hotel
      that they are with the SIAM conference. At this time, conference costs
      do not include meeting room rental. If SIAM fails to fill the contracted
      room
      block, SIAM is then charged the cost for the meeting rooms on a daily basis,
      along with a hefty penalty. This could increase future registration fees
      to cover these additional risks.</p>
