	<p>
The parent group of the BPDG, the Copy Protection Technical Working Group (CPTWG), will hold its next meeting in Los Angeles on July 19, 2002.
</p>
<p>
$100 gets you a seat at the table and a chance to eat a hearty catered lunch. What's more, you can make a presentation to the CPTWG just by emailing <a href="mailto:Maryann_Nicoletti@mpaa.org">Maryann Nicoletti</a>. In times gone by, the EFF has brought down the GNU Radio people to demonstrate the futility of the BPDG; we'd love to get <a href="mailto:cory@eff.org">your suggestions</a> for future speakers to bring to the meeting (anyone friends with any tony anti-trust attorneys, open source video hackers, ASIC engineers, fair use advocates, or capture-card vendors who'd like to present on the technical feasibility of the BPDG mandate?)
</p>
<p>
The meeting's at the Renaissance Hotel, <GEO TYPE="US">9620 Airport Blvd., LA CA 90045</GEO>, 310.337.2800, and it gets going at 8:30, and wraps at 4PM. 
</p>
<p>
You can get a $89 hotel room next door at the <a href="http://www.fourpointslax.com/">Four Points Sheraton</a>, too. See you there!

<PRE>
Date:           Thursday 5/23 U.S. / Friday 5/24 Japan
Time:           4:00pm PDT / 7:00pm EDT / 8:00am Japan

Dial:           1-617-801-9781
Passcode:       4919980</PRE>
<P>Since there are a limited number of dial-in lines, all participants
from an organization have been asked to dial from a single location.
In addition, each organization is asked to designate a single
spokesperson.  Participants are also asked to keep their telephones
muted when not speaking.
Note that members of the press are, by CPTWG policy,
explicitly not invited to participate.</P>

	<P>The MPAA has proposed a "special conference call" for BPDG
members to discuss two last-minute proposals (on regulations on
consumer ATSC modulators, and on recording of Unscreened
Content).  Both of these proposals were made by the MPAA, and
might be the subject of considerable debate.  Several consumer
electronics companies, at least, appeared uneasy about the
regulation of modulators.</P>
<P>The call would be held Wednesday or Thursday late afternoon PT.
(Both times are inconvenient for EFF, but we will try to
participate.)</P>

	<P>
A meeting announcement was just sent to the BPDG mailing list.  The
next meeting is at the LAX Renaissance Hotel on Monday, April 29.
It runs from noon to 8:00p, with lunch and dinner included; the fee
for the meeting will be $120 instead of $100, "on account of the
extra meal".  Prospective attendees were encouraged to write to
Maryann_Nicoletti@mpaa.org to advise her that they plan to attend.
</P>

<P>
The topics for discussion at this meeting were listed as follows:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Authorization of protection technologies on Table A (i.e. what are
criteria, and processes)</LI>
<LI>How requirements regarding OTA content retransmitted in scrambled
(possibly non-VSB/QAM modulated) form will be addressed</LI>
<LI>Output of Unscreened/Marked content via consumer VSB/QAM modulation</LI>
<LI>In-the-clear recording of Unscreened/Marked content for certain formats</LI>
<LI>Resolution of bracketed alternatives in the requirements draft</LI>
</UL>

<P>
A rough paraphrase of these:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Which outputs and which recording methods will digital television
receivers be (legally) permitted to use?  How should we determine
which methods will be illegal?  (Since all digital output and digital
removable-media recording technologies will be presumed illegal by
default, what process will someone have to use to cause a technology
to be certified legal?)</LI>
<LI>What happens when a device remodulates a signal (turns it back
into a radio signal)?  Should this practice be allowed, and what
effects will it have?</LI>
<LI>In what circumstances should it be legal to record this content
without encrypting the recording (to "protect" it from the consumer
who owns the recording)?</LI>
<LI>Can we reach an inter-industry consensus on certain language in
<A HREF="http://www.eff.org/IP/Video/HDTV/20020414_bpdg_compliance_rules.pdf">the current BPDG draft</A> on which we have not yet agreed?</LI>
</UL>

	<P>It's possible that we have readers who've never been to
<A HREF="http://www.cptwg.org/">CPTWG</A> or an in-person BPDG
meeting, but would like to attend.  (The next CPTWG meeting is
Tuesday, April 17, and will include a BPDG meeting.)</P>
<P>All you'll need is $100 and transportation to the
<A HREF="http://www.renaissancehotels.com/dpp/PropertyPage.asp?MarshaCode=LAXRR">Renaissance Hotel</A>
at Los Angeles Airport (9620 Airport Blvd., Los Angeles).  The
hotel offers free shuttle service to and from airport terminals.
Once you arrive at the hotel, simply walk up to the conference
room, hand $100 to the MPAA representative, and make out a
name tag for yourself.  Lunch is included.  Most participants
dress formally.</P>
<P>We're told that members of the press are not welcome and are
turned away; there's never been a public statement to that effect
by CPTWG, and its web site has no mention of such a policy, but
a few regulars have conveyed this impression to us.</P>
<P>Public scrutiny of CPTWG's work is sorely needed; please join
us if you can.</P>
<P>The cheapest hotel nearby the Renaissance is probably the
<A HREF="http://www.fourpointslax.com/">Four Points LAX</A>
right next door.</P>

<LI>A telephone meeting in the afternoon (PDT) on Monday, April 15</LI>
<LI>An in-person meeting at the Copy Protection Technical

<LI>Another in-person meeting in Los Angeles on Thursday, April 18</LI>

<P>If you have comments on the schedule of the first and
third of these, you can send them to Michael Ripley at Intel.

many people from BPDG will be at the <A HREF="http://www.cfp2002.org/">Computers, Freedom,

we will, and we hope to see some of our readers there.

What is the BPDG?
</div>
<div class="side">
<P>
In the year 2006 all over-the-air television will be digital. This is pretty hot stuff: crystal-clear pictures, ear-popping audio and interactive features for days. But as the technologists give, the studios take away.
</P>
<p>
The Broadcast Protection Discussion Group is an obscure group of Hollywood studios and technology companies that are negotiating a "consensus" for any gadget or code that can touch the studios' product. Once they're done, they want to go to Washington and ask Congress and/or the FCC to give their "standard" the force of law.
</P>
<p>
So what? Well, this is a radical departure from the way it's usually done. Usually, bright nerds invent something cool and the entertainment industry has a nervous breakdown and runs around telling everyone that the sky is falling (Marconi got sued over the radio, Sony got sued over the VCR, and it took a near miracle to get movies out of the studios' vaults and onto television). People pick up on the tech and all the interesting ways that it can be used as a creative tool, and gradually the entertainment industry realizes that a new day has dawned and gets its act together, starts shipping product for the new media, and takes home yet another squillion dollars. 
</P>
<p>
This time around, the entertainment industry wants to take away all that sloppy, inefficient fooling around where technology companies try out lots of different approaches, where garage inventors go from obscurity to posterity under a hail of customers, where you and I get to invent amazing new uses for our stuff that a bunch of engineers in a board-room never would've thought of in a million years. This time around, everything not forbidden is mandatory. <a href="http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org/archives/000008.html">MORE...</a></div>
