To Distribute Special Dividend by Spin-off Listing of Emperor Capital Group

    HONG KONG, July 20 /Xinhua-PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Emperor
International Holdings Limited (Hong Kong Stock code: 163; ADR: EPRRY) and
Emperor Entertainment Hotel Limited (Stock code: 296) announced their final
results for the 12 months ended March 31 2006 ("Review Period").
    Highlights

    Emperor International Holdings Limited
     -- Profit rose 34.2% from last year to HK$532.4 million
     -- All business segments recorded growth or turnaround
     -- Final dividend of 5.1 HK cents (Total Dividend of 10.1 HK cents)
     -- To distribute special dividend in the form of free shares of Emperor
        Capital Group via spin-off listing

    Emperor Entertainment Hotel Limited
     -- The Grand Emperor Hotel commenced business in January 2006
     -- Profit totalled HK$166.8 million
     -- Final dividend of 2 HK cents
        (Total Dividend of 3 HK cents)
     -- Room to grow to reach full capacity

    Emperor International Holdings Limited ("the Group" or "EIH")
    For the 12 months ended March 31, 2006, EIH recorded turnover of
HK$985.5 million (2005: HK$1.1 billion). Profit attributable to
shareholders surged 34.2% year-on-year to reach HK$532.4 million (2005:
HK$396.8 million).
    Ms Vanessa Fan, Managing Director of the Group, said: "We are delighted
to report the encouraging results during the Review Period. This was mainly
due to increased rental income as well as gains from the revaluation of our
existing investment properties and development projects. All business
segments reported a profit surge or turnaround. EIH also received for the
first time a significant contribution from associate Emperor Entertainment
Hotel Limited."
    Earning per share amounted to 47 HK cents (2005: 45 HK cents). The
Group has proposed distributing a final dividend of 5.1 HK cents. Together
with the 5 HK cents interim dividend, total dividend will reach 10.1 HK
cents (2005: 10.1 HK cents).
    To focus more closely on the core property and hotel businesses, EIH
has proposed spinning-off and listing separately Emperor Capital Group
(ECG), which primarily engages in brokerage, securities and financial
services. Upon listing ECG on the Main Board, The Group plans to distribute
shares of ECG to existing EIH shareholders. The separate listing is subject
to approval by the Listing Committee, the EIH board and shareholders and
the ECG board of directors.
    "The distribution of ECG shares will be a special dividend to EIH
shareholders," Ms Fan said. "It also shows our determination and efforts to
restructure our business portfolio to focus more on property development
and investment -- areas in which we possess execution strength and higher
margins."
    Property Development and Investment
    This business segment accounted for 80% of the Group's total
contributions.
    As the Hong Kong market continued to improve in the Review Period, the
Group's property-related operations have seen income growing steadily.
Turnover from the leasing of investment properties rose 24.6% to
approximately HK$130.5 million (2005: HK$104.7 million), while profit
climbed 32.6% to approximately HK$597.2 million (2005: HK$450.4 million).
    The Group maintained a high overall occupancy rate for its retail
properties, due to the prime locations of the majority of these properties.
    The total carrying value of the Group's property portfolio in Hong
Kong, Macau and mainland China reached approximately HK$4.6 billion. These
properties include shops, offices, apartments, industrial buildings and a
hotel. During the period, the Group did not have any substantial sales of
properties.
    Amid a recovering property market in Hong Kong, the Group reported a
revaluation gain of HK$471.9 million from investment properties and its
Repulse Bay project, which is under development. Profits from lease of
properties excluding the revaluation gain were HK$122.5 million, compared
with HK$90.2 million in 2005.
    In general, the Group made positive and active progress in property
development. In April 2006, the Group announced the acquisition of a piece
of land in Beijing for the construction of a high-end shopping and office
complex. The 88,420 square feet site commands prime frontage along Chang'an
Avenue, a famous tourist, shopping and office district between the second
and third rings of Beijing. The Group plans to build on the site a
comprehensive commercial complex with a gross floor area of approximately
816,000 square feet. It will consist of a retail podium with high-end and
luxury shops, restaurants, entertainment hot spots and car-park facilities,
with a Grade-A office tower above. The investment represents the Group's
expansion towards Beijing and China property market.
    In Hong Kong, the Group completed the basement excavation and
foundation work for the redevelopment at Repulse Bay. The site is for the
development of a 151,000 square feet multifunctional recreation complex,
which should generate long-term rental income. The project is expected to
be completed in 2008.
    Hotel
    The Group experienced a turnaround for the Emperor (Happy Valley) Hotel
during the year. Turnover for the hotel was approximately HK$63.3 million
(2005: HK$51.9 million), with revenue mainly coming from the hotel's 150
guest rooms, karaoke lounge and coffee shop. The hotel enjoyed a profit of
HK$4.1 million, against a loss of HK$5.3 million in the previous
corresponding period.
    The hotel achieved an improvement in room rates and occupancy, which
reached approximately 94% on average.
    Securities Brokerage and Financial Services Turnover from this segment
climbed 23.5% to HK$127.6 million (2005: HK$103.3 million). The result was
boosted by the expansion of the commodity futures business in the region
and the increase in the number of initial public offering in Hong Kong.
Profit rose by 10% to HK$78.9 million (2005: HK$71.1 million).
    The proposed spin-off and separate listing of ECG will enable EIH to be
more focused on its core business of property investment and development.
It will also enable EIH to realise its investment in the ECG. Furthermore,
ECG can establish its own shareholder base and directly raise funds in the
capital markets for its existing operations and future expansion, on an
independent basis according to its own business plans. Such a listing will
also increase the transparency of its business performance and provide
timely information to the market and investors.
    Non-core businesses disposed/discontinued
    On March 31, 2006, the Group completed the disposal of non-core
businesses, in a bid to focus on major, more profitable operations. Those
businesses included wholesaling and retailing of furniture, publishing and
printing operations, and restaurant operations.
    The non-core businesses contributed a total turnover of HK$659.9
million in the period (2005: HK$745.4 million), and a marginal profit of
HK$2.5 million compared with a loss of HK$11.5 million previously. The
disposal and discontinuation have generated capital resources of more than
HK$100 million to the Group, leaving the Group to focus management efforts
on its major and higher profit margin businesses.
    Contributions from associate
    The Group received a contribution of HK$57.9 million from its 35%-owned
associate Emperor Entertainment Hotel Limited ("EEH"). The Macau hotel
commenced business in January 2006 and it brings in contributions as well
as cash dividends to parent EIH.
    Mr Donald Cheung, Property Director of the Group, commented: "We are
pleased that the Group has now entered a new stage. We will focus on our
core business -- property development and investment as well as hotel
operations. We will have strong cash-flow from rental income and through
dividends from EEH."
    Emperor Entertainment Hotel Limited ("EEH")
    The Period is the first time the Group incorporated a full-scale gaming
and entertainment operation in its financial result. The Group's cruise
vessel "Golden Princess" made a fair contribution to the earnings of the
Group, while the flagship project Grand Emperor Hotel in the Macau Special
Administrative Region made a solid debut and contributed cash-flow
following commencement of operations in January 2006.
    Turnover for the Group was HK$345.8 million during the Review Period
(2005: HK$18.2 million), while net profit was HK$166.8 million (2005:
HK$17.6 million). The construction of the Group's property development
project -- a shopping arcade and serviced apartment complex in Shanghai,
PRC -- is proceeding as planned and is expected to be completed in 2008.
    Golden Princess Cruise Liner
    The Group received turnover of HK$137.9 million and profit of HK$49.4
million from its cruise-related operations during the Review Period.
"Golden Princess" was acquired in February 2005 from the Company's
substantial shareholder. The cruise liner provides entertainment, gaming
and accommodation to a maximum of 570 guests.
    Macau Gaming Hotel Project
    The Grand Emperor Hotel in Macau is the flagship of this segment. To
get in early in the fast growing and lucrative market, the Group chose to
acquire an existing building and convert it into a gaming hotel. The hotel
officially commenced business in January 2006, following a renovation that
lasted a short 12 months. It was the first new hotel to launch in Macau in
2006.
    The Grand Emperor Hotel is located at the heart of Macau's city centre,
a short distance from the main ferry terminal and casino landmark Hotel
Lisboa. Targeting medium to high rollers, the Grand Emperor Hotel presently
has 333 slot machine seats and 44 gaming tables in gaming concourses and
VIP rooms featuring mainly baccarat -- the most popular game in Macau with
the best odds among major table games. Anticipated table capacity is 86
across the gaming concourses and VIP rooms. The luxuriously designed hotel
also provides comprehensive entertainment and dining facilities with a
European-themed decor. It has 291 hotel rooms.
    The Group owns 45% of the project. With management control vesting in
the Group and other stakeholders remaining passive investors, the project's
financials are consolidated into the Group's financial statements in order
to provide transparency for the market and investors.
    Gaming Revenue
    Given the fact that the casino has been in operation for approximately
three months during the Review Period, the Group was satisfied with the
casino operations, the performance of which was in line with management
expectations. All segments picked up quickly after the period and expenses
stabilised after the hotel's opening. The management expected further
advancement when the hotel operates at a full capacity of 64 gaming tables
and eight VIP halls.
    Gaming Concourse
    During the period under review, the Group had 44 tables operating in
the mass market-targeted concourse, contributing a gross win of HK$87.5
million. Income was HK$35.0 million since the hotel soft launched in early
January 2006. The 44 tables returned an average win of approximately
HK$23,000 per table per day.
    Slots
    Slot machines contributed turnover of HK$19.7 million during the Review
Period. The 333 seats had an average win of approximately HK$700 per day.
Income was HK$6.1 million.
    VIP room - Self-operated
    The Group has been running one of the six VIP rooms operating within
the hotel since the hotel opened in January 2006. The six tables -- all
offer baccarat -- recorded a rolling of HK$11.1 billion and an income of
HK$117.5 million. Win percentage (calculated before discounts and
commissions) was 2.7%. Average win per table per day was HK$579,000.
    Other VIP rooms
    The Group received income from five of the six VIP rooms operating
within the hotel. Contribution was HK$7.8 million during the period under
review.
    Non-Gaming Revenue
    The Grand Emperor Hotel recorded non-gaming revenue of HK$24.7 million,
comprising mainly contributions from hotel rooms, food and beverage, as
well as rentals from sauna, night club and retail outlets on the ground
floor of the hotel.
    The hotel rooms had an average daily rate of approximately HK$800
during the Review Period. Occupancy of the available guestrooms was 64%. As
a result of active marketing and promotions, occupancy experienced a fast
upward trend, reaching an average of above 80% in the months after the
reporting period.
    Income from food & beverage was HK$8.6 million. Rental from sauna,
night club and retail outlets was HK$3.0 million.
    Property Sales and Development
    This segment recorded a loss of HK$2.6 million.
    The property development project -- to be developed into a retail
development in Yu Yuan, Shanghai -- was in the investment stage during the
reporting period. The Group plans to build on the 22,870 square meter site
a commercial complex. The Group envisages lucrative returns from the
project, in which it contributed only the land, with construction being
undertaken by its local partner which shared a 50:50 spilt and potential
market risk was covered by a put option.
    The main body of the project will be a multi-storey shopping arcade,
and the entire project is expected to have area of more than 110,000 square
metres. During the Review Period, the project completed piling foundation
work and basement excavation commenced in June 2006. The Project will
complete construction in 2008.
    Ms. Vanessa Fan, Executive Director of the EEH, said: "With the opening
of the Grand Emperor Hotel in Macau in January this year, the Group has
repositioned itself as a full-scale gaming operation enjoying significant
contributions from gaming."
    The Group saw both casino and hotel operations improving after the
reporting period and expects further advancement in future. It also
anticipates increasing contributions from the gaming arm, with the
inclusion of additional slot machines and when the hotel operates at a full
capacity of 64 gaming tables in the mass market-targeted concourse,
following the increased supply of dealers from SJM, the gaming
concessionaire and a passive investor in the hotel project.
    "Looking ahead, the Group will not settle for a single project in the
lucrative Macau market. Instead, it is actively looking for expansion
possibilities with further utilisation of the Group's execution strength
and rich assets in the entertainment industry," Ms Fan said. "Meanwhile,
the Group will continue to explore potential business opportunities
elsewhere to maximise shareholder return."
