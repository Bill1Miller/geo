This deluxe high-rise complex is in the heart of downtown Bellevue, within a few blocks of Bellevue Square and other fine shopping locales. The exterior looks pretty much like any other sleek high-rise, but the interior has such Asian touches as antique Japanese <i>tansu</i> (wood chests of drawers) and huge displays of fresh flowers. The rooms are decorated in similarly understated ways, with floor-to-ceiling windows and dark wood and earth tones predominating the color scheme. The service is impeccable. Some rooms have been specially designed for Japanese travelers. Deluxe suites include two bedrooms, bar facilities, and meeting rooms with desks and full-length tables. Guests have access to a health club and pool. The Eques restaurant serves excellent and reasonably priced breakfast, lunch, and dinner; an English-style pub serves a variety of drinks as well as lunch and dinner.

Guests can use a nearby health club. Comfortable chairs surround the fireplace in the large, open lobby, and a circular staircase descends to the lounge, passing a huge bay window and vast view of Lake Washington.

The Alexis is an intimate four-story, European-style hotel in an artfully restored historic 1901 building on 1st Avenue near the waterfront, the Public Market, and the Seattle Art Museum. Guests are greeted with complimentary sherry at this understated and elegant hotel. The rooms are decorated in subdued colors, with at least one piece of antique furniture in each. Some suites feature hot tubs, wood-burning fireplaces, and some have marble fixtures. Unfortunately, none of the rooms have any kind of view, and those facing the avenue can be noisy. Amenities include complimentary Continental breakfast, shoe shines, morning newspaper, and access to workout facilities and private steam room. The Painted Table restaurant is on the hotel's ground floor.

This 1926 Seattle apartment-hotel has a gracious lobby featuring Oriental carpets, large mirrors, and lots of marble. Located on the edge of the downtown office area, but close to the convention center, this reasonably priced hotel is popular with business travelers. Rooms ending with 10 are best because they feature windows on three sides, and all have working spaces with a chair and a table, along with cushioned chairs for relaxing. One drawback here, though, is the noisy heating, air-conditioning, and ventilation system.

The only hotel on Elliott Bay, the Edgewater is an institution, known for the now-defunct tradition of guests' fishing from their waterside windows. In 1988 the new owners banned hotel fishing but remodeled the 238 rooms, the results of which are magnificent. The lobby features oak furnishings and comfortable chairs and sofas, with a fireplace and a panoramic bay window from which you can sometimes see sea lions frolicking. Spacious rooms on the water provide views of ferries, barges, and the Olympic Mountains, and are decorated in rustic Northwest plaids and unfinished wood furnishings.

The Olympic is Seattle's most elegant hotel. In 1982, Four Seasons restored it to its 1920s Renaissance Revival-style grandeur, with the public rooms appointed with marble, wood paneling, potted plants, and thick rugs, and furnished with plush armchairs. Palms and skylights in the Garden Court provide a relaxing background for lunch, afternoon tea, or dancing to a live swing band on the weekends. The Georgian Room, the hotel's premier dining room, exudes Italian Renaissance elegance, while Shuckers oyster bar is more casual. Guest rooms are less luxurious than the public rooms and have a homey feel. They are furnished with sofas, comfortable reading chairs, and desks and decorated with period reproductions and floral print fabrics. Amenities include valet parking, stocked bar, chocolates on your pillow, complimentary shoe shines, and a bathrobe in the room for each guest. Locals drop in occasionally to pamper themselves with a massage and swim at the health club.

As tribute to the state's growing wine industry, each guest room in this small hotel is named for a Washington winery or vineyard. The theme is extended to complimentary servings of local wines each evening in the elegant lobby, where guests can relax on richly upholstered sofas and chairs arranged around the ornate marble fireplace. The rooms, which are decorated in rich color schemes of dark green, plum, deep reds, taupe and gold, are furnished with custom-made cherry-wood pieces. Each room also contains original works by San Francisco artist Chris Kidd. For literary-minded guests, hotel staff will check out and deliver your choice of books from the nearby Seattle Public Library.

This sophisticated but unpretentious hotel has a great location just up the street from the Pike Place Market. It combines the best aspects of a small, French country inn with the informality of the Pacific Northwest, offering a lively setting that's perfect for travelers who prefer originality, personality, and coziness to big-hotel amenities. The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated with comfortable modern furniture and small touches such as fresh flowers and ceramic sculptures. Ask for a room with views of the Market and Elliott Bay. An added plus is a 2,000-square-foot deck, furnished with Adirondack chairs and overlooking the water and the market. Guests also have access to a health club and spa. Three restaurants share the building: Campagne; the Gravity Bar, an ultratrendy hangout with a variety of juices and coffees; and Cafe Dilettante for light meals, fine chocolates, and coffees.

This pleasant older hotel, built in 1927, is conveniently connected with Westlake Center and the Monorail terminal to Seattle Center. Brass fixtures and antiques give both the public and private spaces a muted Oriental feel, and the service is similarly unobtrusive and smooth. The rooms are somewhat smallish, but the Mayflower Park is so sturdily constructed that it is much quieter than many modern downtown hotels. Guests can use a nearby health club.

Built in 1929 and refurbished in 1992, this hotel reflects its original character. The rooms and furnishings, reminiscent of the '20s and '30s, are appropriate for singles or couples but are too small to comfortably accommodate a family. Because of its downtown location and modest rates (which include a Continental breakfast), the Plaza is a good choice for anyone who is not seeking contemporary luxury.

The lobby features an art-glass collection by Dale Chihuly, a Northwest artist of international repute. The Towers (top five floors) feature larger, more elegant rooms with concierge service, and complimentary Continental breakfast. Within the complex is a diverse selection of restaurant and entertainment options, including Banners, which offers an authentic Japanese breakfast, buffet luncheon, and Continental menu; Fullers, one of the best restaurants in Seattle, serving nouvelle cuisine using local ingredients; and Gooey's (named after the geoduck, a large, sausagelike northwestern clam that is the subject of many jokes), the bar-disco nighttime hot spot.

This deluxe European-style hotel, built in 1909 for the Alaska-Yukon Exposition, was designed to look like an Italian villa. The dramatic entrance is along a circular driveway around an Italian fountain, and ringed by palm trees. Sitting high on First Hill, it has wonderful views overlooking downtown and the waterfront. The rooms are smaller than those in a more modern hotel, but are quiet and very comfortable; they're decorated in understated, elegant earth tones. The largest rooms are the corner suites, which have some antiques and spacious baths. The stylish Hunt Club restaurant features exquisite Northwest-Asian dishes, while the dark-paneled Fireside Lounge in the lobby is a warm and inviting spot for sipping coffee, tea, or a cocktail. Other amenities include a complimentary limousine service within the downtown area, concierge, and guest privileges at a nearby athletic club.

This large high-rise hotel in the heart of downtown, the flagship of the Westin chain, is the preferred accommodation of such visiting dignitaries as the President. Located just north and east of the Pike Place Market, it is easily recognizable by its twin cylindrical towers. With this design, all rooms have terrific views over the waterfront and Lake Union. The rooms themselves are airy and bright, and furnished in a plain but high-quality style. A number have been turned into environmentally friendly, "green" accommodations; the children's programs, which include an interactive, kids-only radio network, are equally innovative. The informal Market Cafe, the more formal Palm Court, and Nikko, a stylish Japanese restaurant, as well as three lounges, are located in-house.

This '60s-vintage motel, set off Aurora Avenue (Highway 99), is relatively close to Seattle Center. The decor is comfortable but not fancy, featuring nondescript contemporary furnishings and color schemes of beige and brown or pastels. Service is friendly and brisk. Complimentary Continental breakfast, a cafeteria, weight room, and play area for children make this lodging a good value.

This pleasant hotel is just a few blocks from the University of Washington's campus. Built in 1931 and remodeled many times since, it has managed to retain much of its old-fashioned charm, with a muted-peach color scheme throughout, brass fixtures, and careful, attentive service. The rooms, especially those on the higher floors, have good views of the college grounds with glimpses of Green Lake and Lake Union. The Meany Grill on the ground floor serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner; there is a large street-level lounge as well.

This is a full-service motor hotel, just across I-5 from the University of Washington's campus, making it popular with families and others who have business in the area. The mock-Tudor decor gives its lobby and other public areas a slightly outdated feel, but the service is cheerful and the rooms are spacious and pleasantly decorated in teak furniture, with pale pinks and grays being the predominant colors. The rooms on the freeway side, however, can be noisy.
