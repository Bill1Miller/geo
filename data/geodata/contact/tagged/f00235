Many major publishers have a similar policy.  Unfamiliar packages and letters mailed to our offices will be returned to sender unopened.</P>
<P><font size="-1">If you are interested in having a manuscript considered for publication, we recommend that you first enlist the services of an established literary agent. Many literary agencies can be located in Bowker's Literary MarketPlace (commonly known as the "LMP"), an annual reference publication which can be found in most major libraries. These literary agencies, in turn, have guidelines for submitting manuscripts. You can find out more about the LMP at <A HREF="http://www.literarymarketplace.com">Literary MarketPlace.</A></P><br>

<A NAME="manchester"><h3>William Manchester's <em>The Last Lion, Volume III</em></h3>
<P><font size="-1">William Manchester died on June 1, 2004 at the age of 82. Manchester was a true literary lion and was the author of many important bestsellers published by Little, Brown over four decades, including biographies of Douglas MacArthur, the Rockefeller family and John F. Kennedy. His last book, about life in the Middle Ages, was <em>A World Lit Only By Fire,</em> and it too was a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller. Manchester completed two volumes of a three-volume biography of Winston Churchill, and was well into the concluding volume when a stroke made writing impossible. In May 2004, Manchester appointed a cowriter to finish Volume 3 based on his outline and notes. Paul Reid, a prize-winning journalist who has written several features about Manchester, will pick up where Manchester stopped. Everyone at Little, Brown who worked with William Manchester admired his warm and forceful personality, his grasp of the great individuals and events of our times, and his commitment to the importance of serious writing.

<A NAME="christian"><h3>Christian Division of Warner Books</h3>

<P><font size="-1"><B>Why did Warner Books launch a Christian publishing program?</B><br>
Some of the country's most popular books in recent years have been Christian titles. The Left Behind Series (40 million copies sold) and The Prayer of Jabez (10 million copies sold) have dominated secular bestseller lists.  Christian authors like Jan Karon, Jerry Jenkins, John C. Maxwell, T. D. Jakes, and Bruce Wilkinson have huge followings. Their books are carried by mainstream retailers as well as Christian bookstores. As a result, several New York houses have entered this market.</P>
<br>
<P><font size="-1"><B>Why does Warner Books have a separate division for Christian titles?</B><br>
Publishing books for the Christian audience is similar in many ways to publishing for the general audience. The editorial, marketing and sales functions operate in much the same way, but there are many subtle differences.  First, the editorial content requires an understanding of Christian theology and worldview.  Christian books.even novels.emphasize a spiritual message and context. Second, Christian titles are also marketed through religious media (television, radio and periodicals). Third, Christian books are  sold in religious bookstores, in addition to general market retailers.  There are approximately 2,000 Christian stores nationwide, most of whom belong to the Christian Booksellers Association (CBA). Thus, separate editorial, marketing and sales expertise and focus are needed to reach this audience.</P>
<br>
<P><font size="-1"><B>Who handles Warner's sales into the Christian retail market?</B><br>
Warner Books is represented in the CBA by Noble Marketing Group, <GEO TYPE="US">19216 SE 46th Place, Issaquah, WA 98027</GEO>.  The phone is 615-221-0992 /fax 615-221-0962.</P>  
<br>
<P><font size="-1"><B>Where are the offices for this program?</B><br>
The Christian program is run out of the Nashville office of Warner Books. All inquiries for author interviews, media kits, catalogs, permissions, etc. should be directed to this address:  <B><GEO TYPE="US">10 Cadillac Drive, Suite 220, Brentwood, TN 37027</GEO>.  The phone number is 615-221-0996 ext.221. Fax 615-221-0962.</B></P>
<br>
<P><font size="-1"><B>Does Warner use a separate imprint for its Christian books?</B><br>
Books that are specifically and exclusively written for Christian audiences are identified with the Warner Faith imprint.  However, many Christian authors today are writing for a broader audience and those books are published under the Warner Books imprint.  The determination is based on the content and intended audience of the manuscript.  In addition, Warner has a Walk Worthy imprint for the Christian African American market.</P>
<br>
<P><font size="-1"><B>How many titles are published each year?</B><br>
Warner Books is publishing approximately 35 titles this year for the Christian audience.</P>
<br>
<P><font size="-1"><B>Does this program include fiction and non-fiction?</B><br>
The catalog is divided almost equally between fiction and non-fiction.</P>
<br>
<P><font size="-1"><B>Are there any categories that are currently excluded from the program?</B><br>
We are currently not publishing gift, reference, children's, or poetry books.  We are also not publishing Bibles.</P>
<br>
<P><font size="-1"><B>What is the procedure for submitting a manuscript?</B><br>
The Time Warner Book Group guidelines apply for the Christian program.  Please consult the <B>Manuscript Submissions</B> section of Frequently Asked Questions.</P>

<A NAME="copyright"><h3>Editions and Other Copyright Page Information</h3>
<P><font size="-1">
On the copyright page of books, "First edition" means that this is the first time the
book has been published. The numbers below that counting down from 10 indicate the
number of the current printing, identified by the lowest number. For example, if a book
carries the line "First edition" and the numbers below are 10 9 8 7, that indicates the
