			<p class="RSProfileCASays">While Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Pizza Hut might not seem a natural fit, they are a winning combo for fast food conglomerate Yum! Brands.  With more stores than McDonald's in 100 countries, Yum's corporate abuse has affected people on multiple levels of its operations from toy factory workers and farmers to store employees and managers.  Yum! Brands and its fast food competitors strive to sell food cheaply, which comes at the expense of agricultural workers.  The company's indifference to the poverty of growers and laborers led to a three-year boycott of Taco Bell headed by tomato farm workers from the Immokalee region of Florida.  Under public pressure Taco Bell agreed to pay higher rates for tomatoes, modestly increasing the pay of nearly 1,000 workers who earn an average of $7,500 per year.  This agreement, and the fact that minorities account for 43 percent of managers at Yum! stores set important precedents but the company has the capacity to do more.  Yum! has been cited for sourcing toys from sweatshops, abusing labor standards in its stores and lacking transparency with regard to GMOs in its food.  Consumers should pressure Yum! to raise its sustainability standards beyond tomato prices.</p>

			The Laguna Lake Development Authority in Manila, Philippines ordered KFC to close its area store on the grounds of violating effluent emissions standards.  The state agency found that KFC had been discharging untreated waste water into a lake supplying water to Manila since April 2005.  Tests showed contaminants in the water at one thousand times the legal limit.  KFC was also ordered to pay a fine of 1,000 pesos (US$18.94) per day, backdated to April 11, 2005.<br />

			The Amazon rainforest is home to nearly 10% of the world's mammals, 15% of the world's known land-based plant species, and about 220,000 people from over 180 different indigenous nations. However, an estimated 1.2 million hectares of what was once rainforest have been destroyed, mostly illegally, to grow soybeans for animal feed. Greenpeace’s report entitled, “Eating up the Amazon,” highlights the connections between rainforest destruction, rapid expansion of soy farming, and KFC’s branch in European. KFC purchases chicken from Sun Valley, which is division of the Cargill group. Cargill operates 13 silos in the Amazon rainforest region and is the leading corporation financing and facilitating rainforest destruction. According to Greenpeace’s Amazonia Campaign coordinator Paulo Adario, “KFC needs to take deforestation off the menu before it is too late for the largest tropical forest on Earth.”<br />

			According to a 2005 report by China Labor Watch entitled “The Toy Industry in China: Undermining Workers’ Rights and Rule of Law,” highlights the violations of worker rights in toy plants in Dongguan City, Guangdong Province. The report specifically highlights the Kai Long manufacturing plant in Hong Kong, which exports toys for Hasbro, Mattel, McDonald’s, and KFC. Violations of international labor laws and those of China include:<p>
<ul><li>Routine 14.5 hour weekdays with only one day off a month</li>
Wages at 59 percent of the local minimum wage standard in Dongguan City
<li>No overtime compensation</li>
<li>Workers deprived of 43 percent of their legal wage, earning .0125 to .025 cents per toy they produce</li>
<li>Inadequate and unsanitary working conditions and dorm rooms</li>
<li>No insurance for regular workers</li>
<li>No independent trade unions</li></ul>
<p>Li Qiang, the executive director of China’s Labor Watch commented: “Abusive conditions persist, threatening to undermine any gains made in workers’ standard of living and hindering the development of rule of law in China.”<br />

			In August 2005 California Attorney General Bill Lockyer filed suit against nine producers of potato chips and french fries concerning toxic contents in their popular foods.  Lockyer is seeking a court order requiring the companies to warn consumers that some of their food products are made with acrylamide, a chemical identified by the state as a human carcinogen.  Plaintiffs in the case include McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, Frito Lay, H.J. Heinz, Proctor & Gamble and Wendy's.<br />

			<p><strong class="RSProfileAlertCat">Worker Rights</strong><br />
			Yum! has been involved in disputes over Workers' Rights:
<ul>
<li>In early 2001, 400 Florida farm workers, claiming they were underpaid, picketed and urged a national boycott of Taco Bell, although the company does not directly employ them. The farm workers said they were frustrated trying to deal with their employers and felt that the chain's target market of 18 to 24 year olds would be sympathetic to their cause. Workers are paid 40 to 45 cents for every 32 pounds of tomatoes they pick for Taco Bell and other companies. The US Department of Labor reports that farm workers average $7,500 a  year on average and receive no benefits. </li>

<li> In February 2003 about 60 tomato pickers from Florida picketed the Irvine headquarters of Taco Bell and began a hunger strike, protesting low wages and a lack of paid overtime and health benefits from the companies that sell tomatoes to Taco Bell. The Coalition of Immokalee Workers has asked Taco Bell to pressure growers into improving working conditions and to pay growers an extra penny for each pound of tomatoes it buys in order to boost pickers' wages. Currently, the laborers say that they earn between $7,000 and $7,500 a year and a penny increase would nearly double their earnings. 
However Taco Bell said the labor dispute is between the workers and their employers, calling the protesters efforts "misdirected." A spokesperson for Taco Bell said, "They do not work for Taco Bell" and that the company bought only 2.8 million pounds of tomatoes from one Florida grower, which accounted for less than 1% of the tomatoes distributed by the company.</li>
<li> In May 2001 Pizza Hut paid $10 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed against the company for failing to produce overtime pay. The suit was filed by salaried workers who claimed they were misclassified as exempt from time-and-a-half overtime wages.  
<li> In February 2000, Taco Bell agreed to pay $9 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by 3,000 California employees who stated that they were not paid overtime. </li>

			KFC and Pizza Hut were among six food franchises that were found under-paying workers and hiring minors, according to a report by a Korean government department. The ministry investigated the fast-food sector in July and discovered that more than 14,000 part-time workers were not being paid properly for over-time work. The fast-food chains have been ordered to repay almost $2 million in wages. Overall, the ministry’s report said KFC was the worst offender, with payment with-held from 5,119 of its employees.  Also, the investigation revealed that there were thousands of cases of under-age employment--under 15 years old-- and of forcing part-time employees to work longer than the maximum seven hours a day.<br />

			In light of the EPA’s on-going investigation of the PFOA family of manufacturing chemicals which are known to contain the questionably hazardous chemical C-8, in July 2003, the Environmental Working Group asked popular fast food companies to disclose whether the food packaging products they use contained a chemical coating made of fluorinated telomers.  DuPont, the first manufacturer of Teflon, which is produced with C-8 claims the chemical is not harmful to humans, but  it has been found to cause reproductive and developmental problems in laboratory animals. Yum! declined to reply to EWG inquiries about the contents of its fast food packaging wrappers.<br />

			In March 2001, a guilty verdict was handed down in a class action lawsuit filed by thousands of current and former Taco Bell Corp. employees in Oregon who claimed that they were encouraged to doctor their time cards so that store managers could meet productivity deadlines and get bonuses. According to an attorney for the plaintiffs damages and penalties could be in the millions of dollars. An attorney for Taco Bell said that when the company was made aware of the situation it fired several managers. Taco Bell is considering appealing the decision.<br />

			<p><strong class="RSProfileAlertCat">Animal Welfare</strong><br />
			Kentucky Fried Chicken, owned by Yum!, has been criticized for its Animal Welfare Practices:
<ul>
<li> As of December 2003, KFC refused to respond to PETA’s requests that the company produce proof it has reduced the cruel treatment of animals by their suppliers.  PETA began its "Kentucky Fried Cruelty" campaign against KFC after McDonald’s, Burger King, and Wendy’s agreed to adopt new measures for the treatment of animals raised by their suppliers.  PETA’s shareholder resolution with Yum! Brands calls upon the company to issue a report detailing exactly how its animal-welfare practices conform to its stated goal to only deal with suppliers who "provide an environment that is free from cruelty, abuse and neglect." </li>

<li> In December 2003, members of PETA protested the abusive treatment of chickens by KFC’s suppliers at the Yum! Brands’ 2003 Conference for Investors and Analysts.  Although PETA had registered legitimately for the conference as a shareholder (PETA has purchased Yum! stock), PETA was denied entrance to the conference. </li>
<li> In July 2003, PETA filed a complaint in California Superior Court to seek an injunction against KFC and its parent company, Yum! For making false statements about its animal welfare practices in advertisements and and on the company's website. According to PETA, these statemetns mislead consumers and are "unlawfully deceptive." PETA claims KFC abuses the more than 700 million chickens raised and slaughtered for its operations each year. </li>
<li>In July 2004 an undercover Peta activist, who worked in Pilgrim Pride slaughterhouse for 8 months, released a video documenting mass cruelty by Pilgrim's workers against chickens in slaughterhouses, including stamping on live birds and throwing them against walls. Pilgrim Pride is a major supplier of chickens to KFC. Peta say their agent witnessed "hundreds" of acts of cruelty. The company responded by releasing the following statement: "KFC is appalled by the actions of Pilgrim's Pride employees at this one facility". The company has sent its own inspector to the plant, and asked Pilgrim's Pride to fire some 11 workers, which it did. KFC has also asked the supplier to install security cameras to monitor the plant in future.  KFC  also said it "sent a letter to all suppliers to make sure they continue to follow the industry's animal welfare guidelines."
