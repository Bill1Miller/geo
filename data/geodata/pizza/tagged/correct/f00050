The world can never win the battle against the obesity epidemic as long as the purveyors of the food that makes us fat continue to produce and market their unhealthy products. Instead, these giant conglomerates are constantly striving for new ways to peddle their food porn. One method is to target children with numerous ads on television to lure them into fast food restaurants with toys or other gifts that will induce whole families to eat high-fat, sodium-laden, sugary foods.
<p>
Another marketing technique is to enlist the public libraries in this junk food marketing program. The process usually involves a coupon for a fast food item if a child reads a certain number of books. In order to collect the reward, the child needs an adult, usually the family, to bring him/her to the restaurant.
<p>
In early 2003 Vegetarians in Paradise launched a campaign to discourage libraries from offering fast food to children as a reward for reading books. The target of the VIP campaign was In-N-Out Burger chain that was rewarding children who read five books with a certificate for a hamburger. In our stories at

<br>
we pointed out the negative health aspects of this type of food and how libraries were becoming marketing agents for fast food chains. 
<p>
After a hiatus of a few years, the fast foodies are back with a new promotion that offers food as a reading incentive. This time it's the pizza dinosaur with a bright orange bookmark coupon for a slice of Shakey's pizza. 
<p>
We realize that fast food companies like Shakey's and In-N-Out Burger will continue to employ all types of techniques to push their products to children, but we feel that libraries should be savvy enough to say, "No" to these hucksters.
<p>
<b><i>Vegetarians in Paradise</i></b> has drafted a letter to the Los Angeles Public Library that is distributing these coupons to children as part of the current summer reading program. Our letter appears below. We invite our readers to join us by writing to LAPL to ask them not to use <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> food as a reading incentive. <br>

<p>
Dear Ms Holmes:
<p>
In an era where health professionals are distressed by the childhood obesity epidemic, it seems incongruous that one of the largest library systems in the nation would offer pizza as a reading incentive for children. 
<p>
We applaud the Los Angeles Public Library for its efforts to encourage young people to read and for offering them non-food incentives like book bags, folders, stickers, bookmarks, and certificates.  
<p>
We are delighted that children have the opportunity during their summer vacation to attend story times and book clubs as well as enjoy magicians, puppeteers, authors, and illustrators in special library programs.
<p>
Rewarding children with coupons for Shakey's pizza is wrong for many reasons. The library is not only acting as an advertising medium for a national fast food chain, but it is also encouraging young children to eat pizza loaded with refined white flour, excessive sodium, and cheese with a high level of saturated fat.  
<p>
Like television programs targeting young children with junk food cereal advertising, this Shakey's campaign lures families to the restaurant by giving one or more of their children each a slice of pizza. Each coupon almost guarantees a family visit to the restaurant.
<p>
A child who is not satisfied with one piece and purchases another, plus a soft drink, will add 500 to 750 calories to his/her daily food intake.
<p>
We strongly feel that rewarding children for reading by giving them fast food is misguided. Hopefully, you will reconsider this promotional effort and utilize numerous other incentives that will encourage young people to read to expand their minds without expanding their waistlines.
<p>
Sincerely, 
<p>
Zel and Reuben Allen
