                            FORM OF PROMISSORY NOTE


$_______                                                         August __, 2000


     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Frederick R. Hipp ("Maker"), does hereby promise to pay
to California Pizza Kitchen, Inc., a California corporation ("Holder"), at <GEO TYPE="US">6053
West Century Boulevard, Suite 1100, Los Angeles, California 90045-6430</GEO>, or at
such other place or places as Holder may designate, the principal sum of
_____________________________ Dollars ($_______), together with interest at the
rate of [eight and one-half] percent ([8.5]%)/1/ per annum on the unpaid
principal amount from time to time outstanding hereunder, with interest and
principal payable as provided as below.

     This Promissory Note (this "Note") is made and given in connection with a
loan to Maker by Holder made in connection with the tax liability incurred by
Maker upon the exercise of options to purchase shares in the Holder (the "Option
Shares").  The amounts due under this Note are subject to offset against amounts
due to Maker by Holder under certain conditions.

     Interest shall be calculated based on a 360-day year and shall accrue on a
monthly basis to be paid at the same time as the principal.  The principal and
interest of this Note is due and payable on the earlier of (i) three days after
the date Maker sells any of his Option Shares, (ii) 30 days after the date
Maker's employment with Holder is terminated for "Cause" or after the date Maker
voluntarily terminates his employment, (iii) one year after the date Maker's
employment terminates due to death or "Disability," and (iv) August ___, 2002.
For purposes of this paragraph, the terms "Cause" and "Disability" shall have
the meanings set forth in that certain Severance Agreement by and between Holder
and Maker dated as of March 31, 1998.

     In addition, as partial payment to be applied against amounts owed
hereunder, Holder shall withhold and apply fifty percent (50%) of any amounts
which would otherwise be payable to Maker as bonus compensation (calculated on
an after-tax basis) until this Note is repaid in full.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Maker, at his sole option, may prepay this Note at any time or from
time to time, in whole or in part.

     All payments received on account of this Note shall be applied first to
interest, then to charges and fees payable hereunder and then to the unpaid
principal balance hereof.

     Maker hereby waives all notices, demands and presentments for payment, all
notices of default, nonpayment, intention to accelerate maturity, acceleration
of maturity, protest and dishonor, and diligence in taking any action to collect
amounts hereunder.


---------------------------
/1/ LIBOR plus 1.5% on the date of execution
&lt;PAGE&gt;

     As security for the prompt performance, observance and payment in full of
the amounts due to Holder hereunder as principal and interest, together with all
expenses of obtaining or endeavoring to obtain payment thereof, or enforcing
this Note, including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, Maker hereby
grants to Holder a continuing security interest, a lien upon, and a right of
setoff against, and Maker hereby assigns, transfers, pledges and sets over to
Holder, all of the Maker's rights, title and interest in, to and under the
Options Shares and all accessions and additions to, and any replacements of and
substitutions for, any of such Option Shares, and all proceeds from a sale or
other disposition of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Collateral").
Maker hereby delivers the certificates representing the Option Shares to Holder
in order to perfect Holder's security interest therein.

     Maker shall not pledge, mortgage, encumber or otherwise permit the
Collateral to be subject to any lien, security interest or charge, other than
the security interest provided for herein, including security interests junior
in right to the interest of Holder, without the prior written consent of Holder.

     If this Note or any part of the indebtedness represented hereby shall not
be paid when due, by offset or otherwise, Holder shall have the full power to
sell, transfer or otherwise deal with the Collateral or the proceeds thereof.

     If this Note or any part of the indebtedness represented hereby shall not
be paid when due, by offset or otherwise, then Holder may place this Note or any
part of the indebtedness represented hereby in the hands of a third party for
collection.  Maker agrees to pay, in addition to all other amounts due
hereunder, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the collection or
enforcement of this Note, including without limitation court costs, attorneys'
fees (whether or not suit be brought), and attorneys' fees for bankruptcy
proceedings, appeals and anticipated post-judgment collection services and
Holder may take judgment for all such amounts in addition to all other sums due
hereunder.

     The acceptance by Holder of any payment that is less than the total of all
amounts due and payable at the time of such payment shall not constitute a
waiver of Holder's rights or remedies at that time or at any subsequent time,
without the express written consent of Holder.  This Note may be waived,
changed, modified or discharged only by an agreement in writing signed by the
party against whom enforcement of any waiver, change, modification or discharge
is sought.  A waiver by Holder or a failure to enforce any covenant or condition
of this Note shall not operate as a waiver of any such covenant or condition or
affect the right of Holder to exercise any right or remedy not expressly waived
in writing.

     The rights and obligations of Maker and all provisions hereof shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
California, notwithstanding any choice of law statute, principles or regulations
to the contrary.

     If any provision of this Note, or the application thereof to any
circumstance, is found to be unenforceable, invalid or illegal, such provision
shall be deemed deleted from this Note or not applicable to such circumstance,
as the case may be, and the remainder of this Note shall not be affected or
impaired thereby.

                                       2
&lt;PAGE&gt;

     All notices, requests, demands and other communications under this Note
shall be in writing and shall he deemed to have been delivered and received (i)
five business days after having been deposited in the United States mail and
enclosed in a certified or registered post-paid envelope; (ii) one business day
after having been sent by overnight courier; and (iii) on the same day when
personally delivered or sent by facsimile communications equipment of the
sending party on a business day, or otherwise on the next succeeding business
day thereafter; in each case addressed to the respective party at California
Pizza Kitchen, Inc., <GEO TYPE="US">6053 West Century Boulevard, Suite 1100, Los Angeles, CA
90045</GEO>, or at such other address of the Holder that then represents the address
of the Holder's corporate headquarters or to such changed addresses as the
parties may have filed in accordance therewith.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Maker has executed this Note as of the date first set
forth above.

                                      -------------------------
