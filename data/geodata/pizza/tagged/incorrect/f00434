<p class="rdheadline"><B>Domino's Pizza Announces Second Quarter 2006 Results
</B>
<br>
<span class="textbold">

</span> <br></p>
<p>
<span class="news.pre">
<PRE>
    ANN ARBOR, Mich., July 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Domino's Pizza,
Inc. (NYSE: <A HREF="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=prnewswire&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=DPZ">DPZ</A>), the recognized world leader in pizza delivery, today
announced results for the second quarter ended June 18, 2006. Diluted EPS
was $0.39, up nearly 15% from year ago levels. Diluted EPS includes the
impact of reduced share counts and a tax benefit. International same store
sales grew 5.7% during the quarter, marking the 50th consecutive quarter of
international same store sales growth.
    Second Quarter Highlights:

     except per share data)                  Second           Second
                                             Quarter          Quarter
                                             of 2006          of 2005
    Revenues                                  $327.7           $347.0
    Net income                                 $24.5            $23.1
    Weighted average diluted shares       63,340,062       67,567,250
    Diluted earnings per share                 $0.39            $0.34


    - Revenues were down 5.5% for the second quarter compared to the prior
      year period, due primarily to lower domestic distribution revenues.
      Distribution revenues decreased 9.7% because of lower food prices,
      primarily cheese, and lower volumes due to a decrease in domestic
      franchise same store sales.  The average cheese block price per pound
      was $1.17 in the second quarter of 2006, down 22.5% from $1.51 in the
      second quarter of 2005.  Revenues from international operations
      increased 6.3% on strong retail sales growth.
    - Net income was up 6.0% for the second quarter compared to the prior year
      period, driven primarily by strong performance in our international
      business, lower cheese prices and a tax benefit of approximately $2.9
      million recognized as a result of the sale of our Company-owned
      operations in France and the Netherlands.  Net income was negatively
      pressured by a 4.9% decrease in domestic same store sales growth,
      increased interest expense and lower distribution volumes related to
      lower domestic same store sales.
    - Diluted EPS was $0.39 for the second quarter, up 14.7% from the prior
      year period, driven by both an increase in net income and a reduction in
      diluted shares outstanding primarily due to the positive effect on share
      counts as a result of our $145.0 million share repurchase in the first
      quarter of 2006.  Diluted EPS included a $0.05 per share benefit from
      the aforementioned tax item.

    - The decrease in domestic same store sales was due primarily to stronger
      promotion performance and related higher same store sales comparisons in
      the prior year.
    - The 5.7% increase in international same store sales marks the 50th
      consecutive quarter of positive international same store sales growth.
    - Global retail sales increases were driven primarily by increases in
      international same store sales and worldwide store counts.
    David A. Brandon, Domino's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said:
"Our sales comparisons in the first half of 2006 were a significant
challenge. We were lapping extraordinary prior-year sales performance while
operating in a much weaker consumer-spending environment. We are not happy
with our sales performance during the first half of this year and we are
working hard to address this situation. However, it is valid to note that
this rather lackluster sales environment demonstrates the resiliency of our
business model. Despite difficulties in growing our top line during this
timeframe, our bottom line continued to grow, and we continued to generate
strong cash flows. This steady and reliable cash flow enables us to
consistently deliver for our shareholders by utilizing a capital structure
that appropriately leverages the Company; paying an industry-leading
dividend; and making opportunistic share repurchases."
    Brandon continued, "The ultimate test of any business model is how it
performs in both good times and tough times. I am proud of our bottom-line
performance during the first half of the year in the face of a difficult
market environment and I have a great deal of confidence our franchisees
and team members will work together to re-establish our sales momentum in
the second half of the year."

    Company Sells Operations in France and the Netherlands
    On May 1, 2006, the Company signed a stock purchase agreement to sell
its Company-owned operations in France and the Netherlands to our master
franchise group in Australia and New Zealand. The sale closed subsequent to
the second fiscal quarter ended June 18, 2006.
    During the second quarter, the Company recognized a tax benefit of
approximately $2.9 million relating to the sale of these operations. The
Company will account for the remainder of the transaction during the third
fiscal quarter ending September 10, 2006 and does not expect the
transaction to have a material impact on its financial condition or results
of operations.
    Liquidity

    As of June 18, 2006, the Company had:
    - $788.8 million in total debt,
    - $23.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, and
    - borrowings of $93.7 million available under its $125.0 million revolving
      credit facility (net of letters of credit issued of $31.3 million.)
    The Company has repaid more than $45.0 million of debt year-to-date,
including $10.0 million in the second quarter. The Company also borrowed
$100.0 million in the first quarter which, along with cash from operations,
was used to repurchase and retire $145.0 million of common stock from its
largest shareholder.
    The Company's average borrowing rate for the second quarter of 2006 was
6.4%. The Company is not required to make the next scheduled senior credit
facility principal payment of $1.3 million until June 30, 2007. The Company
is not required to make principal payments on its senior subordinated notes
until 2011.
    The Company incurred $9.4 million in capital expenditures during the
first two quarters of 2006. The Company incurred $15.2 million in capital
expenditures during the first two quarters of 2005 attributable to
increased spending related to the renovation of the Company's headquarters.
    Comments on Regulation G
    In addition to the GAAP financial measures set forth in this Press
Release, the Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures
within the meaning of Regulation G, including metrics commonly used in the
quick- service restaurant industry that are important to understanding
Company performance.
    The Company uses "Global retail sales" to refer to total worldwide
retail sales at Company-owned and franchise stores. Management believes
global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues, because
franchisees pay royalties that are based on a percentage of franchise
retail sales. Management reviews comparable industry global retail sales
information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the
Domino's Pizza(R) brand. In addition, distribution revenues are directly
impacted by changes in domestic franchise retail sales. Retail sales for
franchise stores are reported to the Company by its franchisees and are not
included in Company revenues.
    The Company uses "Same store sales growth," calculated including only
sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable period of the prior
year. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to
domestic same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales
are reported on a constant dollar basis which reflects changes in
international local currency sales.
