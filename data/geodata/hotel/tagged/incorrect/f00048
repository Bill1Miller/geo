<div id="box2"><p><span class="titles"><id="a000606">Footsies, Santa Monica</span><br>
      July  7, 2006 </p>

		<p><img src="http://www.montanaave.com/footsie/footsie-1.jpg"></p>

<p>When Oprah tells you to do something - you do it. Even if it's a year later and you don't think a bra can really change your life. Although we've tried here and there, and despite being in a town where breasts are one of the main attractions, finding a specialty boutique that sells lots of brands and has qualified sales people to fit you right has been a challange. We never left a shop with a bra that made us feel like we were 18 again.</p>

<p>Luckily, Footsie on Montana was found. </p>

<p>Despite a rather cheeky name for a store that sells nothing to do with footware, this place is serious business. Whether you're proud of your little ones (waves hand) or in-love with your new ginourmous ones (waves to Pamela Anderson), this little boutique has the bra for you. Trust us ladies, they'll make you perky and proud without pain or embarrassment.</p>

<p>We went in looking for a great every day t-shirt bra and a strapless number for summer dresses. We didn't want anything too padded (which is hard to find in this town) and our sales person instantly knew what bra would be best. After a quick measurement we found out we had been wearing the wrong size and then were presented with one every day bra the saleslady promised we'd love and the same with a strapless in the new, correct size.</p>

<p>Perfect fit on try one. And we know it fit because the sales woman came into the room and took a look and made adjustments. No more guessing about if the bra looks good or not - they'll tell you here. That's especially important because all sales are final. But trust us, you won't be returning anything from here. You'll be too busy strutting around, knowing that Oprah was right about finding the perfect fit.</p>

<p>TIP: It's a small place so come during the week or early on the weekend to get more personal service. And bring money - with matching knickers and pretty but pracitcal bra's you'll want to drop some dough. </p>

      June 18, 2006 </p>

		<p><img alt="200264903-001.jpg" src="http://WWW.girlsguidetocitylife.com/losangeles/guides/200264903-001.jpg" width="240" height="160" /></p>

<p>Too pooped to go get pampered? Hey, it's happened. Luckily Becca Star has taken her 12 years experience in the spa and beautify industry and created a dream team of people  who will come to pamper you (in uniform with candles and flowers no less) whereever you want, whenever you want. What could be easier or more relaxing than that?</p>

<p>Need an afternoon facial?  Want a massage after work to unwind? Feel like some early morning yoga in your hotel room with an instructor? Like a late night head to toe makeover? How about a private clairvoyant to see how far into the future you can afford this beck and call service? Virtual Spa has got you covered. </p>

<p>We happened to have them make our toes pretty at an event at the Avalon Hotel. Sitting on couches and dishing like only girls can, our beauty professionals were just that. Our feet were massaged, cleaned and painted, leaving them baby soft and decorated like chic ladies we were meant to be. Putting on our strappy sandals felt oh, so much better. The best part? Lounging in a hotel room they'd transformed into a mini fun pamper place instead of a stuffy spa. We didn't have to whisper in hushed voices or wear robes that so didn't match our polish like most spa's we've been to. With Virtual Spa, you get to chose the decor, the place, the time and your wardrobe.</p>

<p>This lead us to think of other possibilities for the virtual spa. In town on business with little time to spare? Call them in for a quick facial between work and dinner. Or have a girl's night in spent with a few friends and letting the Virtual Spa glamour girls get to work while you dish in your own place with your own theme should you wish.  Where else could you cram a room full of girls and get head to toe fabulous without having to wait in line or miss gossip by being in another room? Also, it beats fighting traffic, looking for parking and waiting until someone's ready for you. </p>

<p>Besides, we love full service, especially at our door.</p>

      May 25, 2006 </p>

<p>Gluten got you down? Wheat make you worry? Cutting out carbs or vegging on veggies? The run - don't walk - to Solar Harvest Cafe in Beverly Hills where they cater to people from protein cravers to food allergy avoiders.</p>

<p>Owner Elissa Meadow (who is often on hand and checks in on people whilst they eat) created Solar Harvest to offer people yummy healthy eating choices at an affordable price in an environment that's just as healthy. With bamboo panelling, light colours, eco-friendly furnishings, individual hand-soap sanitizers at every table and filtered water that flows freely, eating here is good for you inside and out. They also work with local producers and sustainable agriculture to make this one green place to eat.</p>

<p>Sound too granola girl? I assure you it's just as chic as any other Beverly Hills eatery. And the fact that eating here won't stress you out if you're counting calories or avoiding wheat makes it more relaxing than places that seem swank on the outside and leave you wondering if the salad really <i>was</i> ok.</p>

<p>Here, I can honestly eat without worry, knowing that they understand food allergies and make food that won't only keep me from getting sick but taste absolutely amazing. I'm in-love with their Gluten-Free Tuna Melt; warm, filling and oh-so-good! And their gluten-free chocolate cake? Let's just say I don't feel deprived when eating here. </p>

<p>And if gluten isn't your problem but carb counting is, there's fantastic choices here too - just follow their colour-coded menu to find a meal that's right for you. From protein rich, to gluten free to comfort food, they have six different categories that make it easy to order. So you're never left wondering how to fit the burger into your diet.</p>

<p>Even if you don't have food allergies and can eat anywhere you want, this is still a place to try. The food, the service, and the streamlined decor make it great for a quick lunch or an evening date. </p>

<p>Their motto is "Food that Works for You" which is such a nice change when it seems like in this city, you always have to work for something. Here's the place you get a break.<br />

<div id="box2"><p><span class="titles"><id="a000335">Chaya, Venice</span><br>
      May 20, 2006 </p>

		<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/31/54096821_990b862571_m.jpg" align="right" style="padding-left:5px;">It was time to celebrate, kick up my heels and enjoy some great food and Chaya in Venice fit the bill perfectly.</p>

<p>With its happy hour for the hip, this place is packed by 6. But waiting here isn't a problem - just sip one of their famous pineapple infusion (fresh pineapple marinated in Fris vodka) at the bar or any thing from their award-winning wine list and strike up a conversation with everyone else waiting to be seen, oh, I mean table.</p>

<p>The wait, the loud music and the sometimes 'too cool for school' attitude is worth it when it comes to the food which specliases in international sea food dishes and full sushi bar (managed for over seven years by acclaimed sushi chef, Yuichi Natori). Hungry but not famished and in need of something light but different, I went with their sushi. Trusting our waiter's recommendations we went with a few exotic things, things I normally wouldn't have chosen. But the waiters here know Chaya and aren't afraid to share what you should and shouldn't get - so listen to them. You'll be glad.</p>

<p>Our sushi was incredible, some of the best in L.A. as was their Ginger Creme Brulee - another recommendation from our waiter. We were surprised to find that we had spent nearly two hours dining without feeling rushed despite the crowds and the music. The relaxed attitude of both the waiters and decor kept us happy and content, even when things got lively.</p>

<p>Chaya was the perfect place to celebrate, whether you want to talk with friends over a table or by making some new ones at the bar.</p>

<p>TIP: Reservations highly recommended, especially since you can do it so easily through their web site.</p>

		<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/34/105140365_3738228c7a_m.jpg" align="right" >There's no way around it - it's a big, red barn which makes Brentwood Country Mart so, well, un-Brentwood. But perhaps that's part of it's charm and why it's been a staple in LA shopping and hanging out since the 1948 when Elizabeth Taylor and Burt Lancaster made it hip to eat take-away chicken  on the picnic tables inside.</p>

<p>With winding, narrow hallways, little boutique shops (most are about 300 square feet) and free parking, this is a great place to shop, run errands, eat, hang out and be seen (you're sure to run into a celebrity or two, after all, they need to pick up flowers, cut their hair, repair those Manolo's, too). You can even write about your time and mail your letter at the post office (we like to send Santa our wishlists from here after perusing shop after shop). And writing home is something you'll want to do because shops here aren't everywhere else which adds another reason why Brentmart is loved by locals.</p>

<p>Shops such as Cath Kidston, Jigsaw, a London retailer of women's and girls' apparel; Sugar Paper, a pretty custom stationer;  Apartment Number 9, a men's haberdasher with a store in Chicago; Marie Mason Apothecary a shop for soap and perfume lovers; and City Bakery which was made famous in lower Manhattan are chic enough to make up for the kitchy outside. And the relaxed atmosphere, personal service without attitude and cheap eats in the outdoor courtyard will keep you around for awhile and quite possibly coming back.</p>

<p>TIP: Come Monday through Saturday - Sunday's most shops are closed. And forget valet - it's the only place in Brentoowd where you have to park your own car. </p>

      October 13, 2005 </p>

		<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/29/52246916_ab8f0320fc.jpg" align="right" style="padding-left:5px;">The weather was cold and grey, my head and body ached from a lingering cold and I was caught in Melrose traffic. I needed a break but stepping into a hipster cafe was the last thing I felt like doing as I was far too miserable to be cool and too tired to figure out menus.</p>

<p>Thankfully Elixir was nearby.</p>

<p>Their all natural, no preservatives, no sugar added tea drinks (either warm or cold) are perfect for any mood you're in. Their Virtual Buddah, which is said to help calm the body and center the spirit, was my drink of choice. After having it prepared at the Gan Bei Tonic Bar, I took my hot drink outside, sat under heaters, in front of the waterfall, in the prettiest candle lit Asian-inspired zen garden sanctuary, reading magazines that they laid out for their customers. The tranquil setting combined with a soothing drink left me in a better state and ready to once again face traffic.</p>

Lucky for me, I found myself at Jin Patisserie in Venice at the right time.</p>

<p>Since 2003, Kristy Choo has been satisfying LA's sweet tooth with beautiful, hand crafted works of art no bigger than your palm. From chocolates to scones, everything made here is fresh, slightly exotic and undeniably good. Trying to decide what to get on the already small menu was hard, so I chose the Afternoon Tea for a sampling. And for only $17, it turned out to be an incredible value.</p>

      October 10, 2005 </p>

		<p>There's one thing that many of us in Santa Monica have in common - dirty cars. Thanks to a dense living area of old apartments that don't have carports, parking on the street under palm trees leaves our pretty car in a sorry state. Without a way to wash at home (or time for that matter), a weekly carwash is a necessity. But with frequent trips, there's cost to think about and the environment.</p>

<p>Enter Lincoln Boulevard Car. From $9.95 you can get a basic car wash (and even gas if you need it) quickly, easily and environmentally friendly. With state-of-the-art brushless equipment, this car wash uses only high-quality soap, not detergent (the latter can fade paint). Well-trained employees go the extra mile to make your car shine by vacumming every inch and hand-drying the outside - including every crevice.</p>

<p>Taking an average of 15 minutes, there's a small cafe to sip your latte while you wait and magazines to read if it's really busy (add extra time for weekends). But for the dirty and the lazy, this is the best way to come clean. </p>

Every turn would expose more and more unique antique furniture and tucked in some loft spaces would be my living quarters, which would change depending on the inventory.</p>

<p>Sue Balmforth made this dream real when she created her store Bountiful, located in the trendy part of Venice on Abbot Kinney.</p>

<p>Over 12,000 square feet of floor to ceiling antiques - many of them French and hundreds of years old - can be found here, though most of them  are found in the back of the store and up rickety stairs here and there. The front carries newer goods such as pretty soaps, shells, linens and pretty kitchen wares (it also smells the best, here) Follow the little pathways around the shop and eventually you'll be led to Sue's bedroom, which you can purchase should you wish (and that goes for her living room, too!).</p>

<p>It was, at first, a little overwhelming - so many beautiful things to look at and I had so little time. But I'll be back. Even if it's just to pretend it's actually <I>my</I> place.</p>

<p>Tip: Don't be intimidated but the shut gate in front; it's to keep her dogs in, not her customers out. Just ring the bell and voila, you'll be invited in. Just don't expect tea - expect to shop.</p>

      October  3, 2005 </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/girlsguide/23165944/" title="photo sharing"><img src="http://photos17.flickr.com/23165944_46b34c3e1f_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom:5px;" align="right"/></a>LA is a city known for style, color and quirkiness so why would someone visit and stay at a dull old Best Western with 30 year old bed covers? Especially when staying in style was never so affordable - or so good.</p>

<p>The Farmers Daughter Hotel has been in the centre of Los Angeles for over 30 years - with neighbours such as The Grove, CBS, farmers market, Melrose Ave, Beverly Hills and Hollywood). With LA's traffic, being near everything is good but usually pricey - especially when you start talking duvets, internet, mini-refrigerators, custom mattresses and beautiful though eclectic decor. But this family-run hotel keeps prices more than reasonable (starting at just $129), so you can afford to spend money in the city (which you will, trust us).</p>

<p>Though country charm can be a scary phrase, The Farmers Daughter combines this with hip decor that makes it modern in that cool retro way, helping you to feel more LA than Kansas.</p>

<p>Large rooms will keep you happy but if you need more space the beautiful outdoor patio is the place to sip cocktails or even take a dip in the pool. After walking around their busy neighbourhood in the heat, you'll be glad for that and their air conditioning.</p>

      September 13, 2005 </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/girlsguide/18244831/" title="photo sharing"><img src="http://photos12.flickr.com/18244831_dfe4e45577_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom:10px;" align="right"/></a>Since Lawrence of Arabia is one of my favourite films, I  thought I had seen it. It wasn't until it played fully restored, in 70mm, and complete with intermission at the Aero Theatre that I really <i>saw</i> it. This was how movies were meant to be seen.</p>

<p>Built in 1939 as a round-the-clock movie house for aircraft workers during war years, The Aero was a favourite theatre for both locals and celebrities alike (Robert Redford visited often when he was young which lead him to purchasing it years later with hopes of using it for Sundance movies). When the war ended and bigger movie houses went up, The Aero fell out of use for many years . It wasn't until American Cinematheque bought it, restored it to its old glory and re-opened the doors the theatre once again began to thrive.</p>

<p>Where else can you see classic films such as Gone With the Wind, Wizard of Oz, The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, Redux, and West Side Story (complete with a few of the original dancers on hand to meet) as well as todays independents, art-house movies and new screenings? </p>

<p>Seeing these movies here gives one a new appreciation for both film and Hollywood. And with comfy seats for only $9, coming often won't hurt your behind or your pocketbook.</p>

      September 10, 2005 </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/girlsguide/13921747/" title="photo sharing"><img src="http://photos10.flickr.com/13921747_8196c67c06_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom:10px;" align="right"/></a></p>

<p>When I arrived at the hotel and was dealing with valet, a man bumped into me as he hurried by but stopped to pardon himself. It was Tom Hanks. I realized at that moment that this hotel was going to be something special.</p>

<p>Sitting right on the beach in Santa Monica, Hotel Casa Del Mar screams Old Hollywood but in that chic, polished, attention-to-detail way (we don't stay in old musty places, dear, trust us). With dark woods and rich colours, the entrance alone is nothing short of spectacular. Then, there are the rooms.</p>

<p>Light, sunny, and oh so breezy; windows with sheers that sway from the ocean wind, glass walls enclose the deep jet tubs so you can view the ocean while you relax and light yellow fabulously deluxe linens make everything feel fresh and cosy. The stereo system and DVD player are nice touches – especially if you have an ipod to plug in and like to boogey a little before drinks in the lounge or if you need to just strike a pose on the chaise a la Marlene Dietrich.</p>

<p>There's no way you could not feel just a little glamorous and Hollywood when laying out on the pool terrace which overlooks the ocean. Even if you're not swimming you can sunbathe and have poolside drinks (after all, you’ll need something refreshing when you’re out in the sun). We love the poolside massages and the fact you can get a beautifying facial in the morning so that you're pretty enough to listen to classic jazz in the lounge come evening. And trust us, you'll want to look your best when drinking wine downstairs, after all, you never know who you’ll run into. It's not just old Hollywood that comes here anymore.</p>

<p>TIP: Splurge on the Ocean View room; there's nothing like it. If staying here isn't an option at least come for drinks and appy's in the lounge - especially on Wednesday when amazing jazz is playing and the lounge is packed with people and conversation. </p>

<div id="box2"><p><span class="titles"><id="a000362">Getty Museum, Los Angeles</span><br>
      September  8, 2005 </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/girlsguide/20563446/" title="photo sharing"><img src="http://photos16.flickr.com/20563446_4ba2d47535_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom:5px;" align="right"/></a>L.A. is known as a city of shopping, fashion, eating and schmoozing; it's all people seem to do. However, that can tire even the best of shopping girls. Luckily, there's the Getty Museum that takes us up and away from the city to give us a little culture.</p>

<p>Created in trust by John Paul Getty with the goal of having a meaningful and attractive collection to as broad an audience as possible, this museum is something everyone should see - and see more than once. It's affordable enough, having only to pay $7 for parking, that you can come and see the rotating exhibits (we can't wait to go back in mid-June for Rembrandt).</p>

<p>A small tram takes you from the parking lot 3/4 of a mile up a hill to the museum which consists of several buildings and massive gardens. Spectacular views of the city are to be had from almost everywhere;  the beaches of Santa Monica and the towers of downtown can be seen by just moving your head side to side. Simply walking the grounds outside can be a day but there's so much more which you can discover either on your own or by free guided tours.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of architecture, you'll appreciate the thousand year old stones (some with fossils) that make up the buildings or trying to count the 3,200 doors. Garden lovers will appreciate the water maze, the zig-zag pathways, beautiful flowers and the lush grass on which you can nap (which you'll need after all the hours it'll take you to see everything). Art lovers will no doubt love the collections here, which range from illuminated manuscripts from the 12th century right up to modern photography. The Decorative Arts exhibit showcased furniture, clocks, tables and more from around the world - including the chair Marie Antoinette sat in to have her hair done. Rooms upon rooms of beautiful furniture dating as far back as the 14th century gave us more than enough ideas on how to decorate our own homes (must get ginormous bed with canopy and gilded towering clock).</p>

<p>Whether you're with a group or need an afternoon break on your own, this is definitely a place to come and get away from it all, and even get a little inspired.</p>

<div id="box2"><p><span class="titles"><id="a000355">Vintageweave Interiors, Los Angeles</span><br>
      September  2, 2005 </p>

		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/girlsguide/23166544/" title="photo sharing"><img src="http://photos19.flickr.com/23166544_4597928664_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom:5px;" align="right"/></a>Hold those plane tickets to Paris ladies – Vintageweave on Fairfax can save you the trip. Owner Kathy Delgado has taken her passion for French antiques, design, and arranging custom baskets and opened up shop - and Hollywood is taking note. It's where A-list celebs such as Debra Messing, David Duchovny and Anne Heche and Hollywood Insiders from the studios to PR  come for gifts (Cameron Diaz received a custom gift basket from here!) and unique furnishings and goods for the home. After one visit, I can see why.</p>

<p>Being someone who adores the Shabby Chic look but not the rummaging for a find, I appreciate Kathy taking the time to find all the goods for me and arranging it artfully in her store so that I can better see pieces I might have over looked if I had to scour isles at flea markets in Provence. She makes each nook and cranny a vignette; telling stories by combining 200-year-old one of a kind lamps with modern glassware. From hand stitched high quality linens to pretty little soaps, Vintageweave is a treasure hunt of beautiful things. It’s also terribly inspiring; her elegant display of cake plates alone gave me ideas!</p>

<p>Her specialty, however, is putting together gift baskets – but not your average, boring, pre-packaged kind. How about a hundred year old hand carved bowl from the South Pacific to hold beautiful hand made sachets filled with true French lavender, some bath salts and something else that just says "thank you?" No? Then all you have to do is let Kathy know your budget, the person and let her go to work – she’ll put something together that will make you think she knows your friend better than you.</p>

<p>From $5 to $5,000 every penny spent here is spent well for it's where you'll find unique, beautiful and oh so charming things either for yourself or someone else. And best of all, you'll come out feeling a little chic as though you'd just flown home from France.</p>

<p>TIP: Pick up a beautiful (and inexpensive) small dress shaped Lavender sachet to keep your clothes smelling wonderful. I use mine for traveling, just tossing it into my clothes cube. Also a portion of certain item's proceeds also go to foundations for Breast Cancer Awareness and Peonies from Heaven for Diabetes Research so check with Kathy to see how you can benefit yourself and someone else with a purchase.</p>

<div id="box2"><p><span class="titles"><id="a000360">Sally Hershberger at John Frieda Salon</span><br>
      September  1, 2005 </p>

		<p>For a salon that began in New York, this place couldn't be any more L.A. with its outdoor pool in the middle, an outside terrace in which to let your highlights set and a celebrity clientele that can only be found in Hollywood.</p>

<p>But that aside, this salon delivers. After a bad colour experience, my blonde hair was more brassy, orange and even pink that I could stand. Step in colour corrector extraordinaire. After three hours of pampering my hair was fabulous - or so I thought. My coulourist found two strands she was not happy with and quickly set in to correct them. I didn't mind however as it gave me more time to sip yet another ice cappuccino out in the sun.</p>

<p>At this salon, people stick to what they do best so don't expect your colourist to cut your hair (she won't) or cater solely to you (she won't - they work several clients at once like Ellen, Christina and Jennifer. And yes, you will be on a first name basis with them after sitting so close together). However, if you need frills just ask - this salon will do almost anything for their clients including ordering you in lunch or giving you a mani-pedi outside. </p>

<p>I'm one who generally hates having my hair done and the salon is the last place I'd call relaxing. But now I'm marking down the three months until I need to go back and get my hair once again fabulous, knowing that they'll do it right, without pain and give me a blow-out to last a week. Besides, having people tell me afterwards how lucky I am to have such a naturally pretty haircolour, well, that all makes it worth it right there.</p>
