<p>Frank Lloyd Wright famously said, "Tip the world over on its side and everything loose will land in Los Angeles".   And he said that before O.J. drove the Bronco or "The Terminator" became Governor.
</p><p>The Los Angeles metro area has been a "boom town" since the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1876, first attracting "the folks" from the Midwest with a blessedly warm and dry climate-- and then becoming a gateway to a magnificent diversity of immigration from throughout the Pacific Rim and Latin America.
</p><p>L.A. is a huge, sprawling, megalopolis-- you could start in one end of L.A. and drive for more than two hours without leaving the county's influence.  The metro area includes smaller cities, such as <a href="/en/Santa_Monica" title="Santa Monica">Santa Monica</a>, <a href="/en/Burbank" title="Burbank">Burbank</a>, and <a href="/en/Long_Beach" title="Long Beach">Long Beach</a>, which broke away many decades ago to form independent governments and "suburban" identities.  Geographically, there is very little rhyme or reason to what is part of the city of LA and what isn't.  For example, <a href="/en/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> isn't a separate city--it's part of the City of Los Angeles-- but adjacent West Hollywood and <a href="/en/Beverly_Hills" title="Beverly Hills">Beverly Hills</a> are not part of the City.

<p>Los Angeles has no less than five <b>airports</b>.
</p><p><b>Los Angeles International</b> <a href="http://www.los-angeles-lax.com/" class='external autonumber' title="http://www.los-angeles-lax.com/">[1]</a> (<b>LAX</b>) is the major gateway.  The airport is mindbogglingly huge, with no less than nine terminals, and the only way to get from terminal to terminal (other than walking) is to use the free "A" shuttle buses that run in a loop between the terminals.
</p>

<p>Connections to and from the airport are equally poor.  There is no direct train service, although there are free shuttle buses to Aviation Station on the Metro Green Line, and hourly LAX FlyAway <a href="http://www.lawa.org/lawaGT.cfm" class='external autonumber' title="http://www.lawa.org/lawaGT.cfm">[2]</a> shuttles to Union Station.  Taxis to downtown LA cost $30-35 and take 30 minutes in good traffic, but can be far slower in rush hour.  On your way to the airport, be sure to show up two hours before your flight as queues for security are often notoriously long and time-consuming.
</p><p>The others are <a href="http://www.lgb.org/" class='external text' title="http://www.lgb.org/">Long Beach Airport</a>, <a href="http://www.burbankairport.com/next/index.html" class='external text' title="http://www.burbankairport.com/next/index.html">Bob Hope (Burbank) Airport</a>,<a href="http://www.ocair.com/jwa_main_page.htm" class='external text' title="http://www.ocair.com/jwa_main_page.htm">Orange County/John Wayne Airport</a> and far flung Ontario airport east of LA. Even though LAX is often cheapest, avoiding LAX will save a lot of hassle because the other airports are small and not as busy (especially Long Beach), but you will typically be farther away from your destination which will entail a lot of driving. 
</p><p>Then again, going anywhere in LA is going to cost you a lot of driving.  If you're going to <a href="/en/Disneyland" title="Disneyland">Disneyland</a> or any of the <a href="/en/Orange_County" title="Orange County">Orange County</a> beaches (<a href="/en/Laguna_Beach" title="Laguna Beach">Laguna</a>, <a href="/en/Huntington_Beach" title="Huntington Beach">Huntington</a>, <a href="/en/Newport_Beach" title="Newport Beach">Newport</a>), consider the Orange County/John Wayne airport. For any of the airports, it is probably best to use the numerous buses and shuttles to get to and from the airport, if you are staying in the area. Locals do this to avoid  dealing with the hassles and cost of parking.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Los_Angeles&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: By train">edit</a>]</div><a name="By_train"></a><h3>By train</h3>
<p>The main <b>Amtrak</b> station is at Union Station, 800 N. Alameda St. next to the Hollywood (US-101) freeway in downtown Los Angeles. The train station also has a Metro Red Line subway station (platforms in station's basement) and Metro Gold Line light rail station (on platforms 1 and 2, parallel to the Amtrak and Metrolink trains), while local city buses stop at various locations around the terminal, including some in the MTA (Patsaouras) bus plaza at the east portal of the station. The train station is patrolled by private security staff and people lingering too long in the seats may be asked to show a ticket. Taxis are available at the west exit and the station is within short walking distance to the Civic Center and Olvera Street. Chinatown and Little Tokyo are also nearby.
</p><p>Union Station is spectacular (opened 1939), but there are several stops within the County that may be better located to your destination. L.A. is big, make sure you get the right stop. Unfortunately, while Union Station has the best bus and light rail options it may be far from other landmarks. Burbank Amtrak Station is next to the Burbank airport where options include Metrolink, bus and rental cars at the Air Terminal.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Los_Angeles&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: By bus">edit</a>]</div><a name="By_bus"></a><h3>By bus</h3>
<p>The <b>Greyhound</b> terminal is at 1716 E 7th St, near I-10 along S. Alameda Ave. You may be approached by panhandlers around the terminal. Friendly strangers who offer you advice are likely to also ask you for money. At least two Wikitravellers have encountered friendly or helpful, but needy, Vietnam veterans here. If you need to spend time at the terminal and want to avoid panhandlers it is suggested that you stay inside the terminal. The terminal was being given some needed renovation in 2003.
</p><p>The terminal is in a dodgy area, and not located conveniently near anything, so walking to other locations is not a good idea. Take a taxi or catch the Metro bus. The Metro bus stop is a short way down the street from the Greyhound terminal exit eastward. You may want to ask for directions before leaving the Greyhound station. While there are private patrols (funded by the local Business Improvement District) during the day (on bicycles), those patrols are not present in the evening.
</p><p>Fortunately, other terminals are in far safer areas and have better access to public transportation. From the north, the North Hollywood station is located at 11239 Magnolia Bl. and is one quarter mile south of the Metro Red Line North Hollywood station. The Hollywood station is at 1715 N. Cahuenga Bl. and is one quarter mile west of the Metro Red Line Hollywood/Vine station.
</p><p>Of note for passengers coming from the east is the El Monte station, at 3501 N. Santa Anita Ave. The station is co-located with a MTA and Foothill Transit bus station, and frequent express bus service to Downtown Los Angeles is available upstairs. The El Monte station also houses a substation of the local county sheriff. Also, from the east, the Pasadena Greyhound station, located one quarter mile west of the Lake Avenue Metro Gold Line station, is an option.
</p><p>From the south, Greyhound passengers should use either the East Los Angeles station, located at 1241 S. Soto St., or the Compton Station, located at 305 N. Tamarind Ave. The East Los Angeles station has multiple lines operating to downtown nearby, while the Compton station is across the street from a Metro Blue Line station.

<p>Los Angeles' <b>massive sprawl</b> and <b>dysfunctional public transportation</b> makes getting around rather painful.   The only rational way of getting around is to rent a car, in which case you'll get a crash course in the complex freeway system and spend hours stewing in traffic jams.
</p>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Los_Angeles&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: By bus">edit</a>]</div><a name="By_bus_2"></a><h3>By bus</h3>
<p>The L.A. <b>bus</b> system is extensive but slow.  Many Angelinos rely on the bus as their primary mode of transportation. Within the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles#Central_Los_Angeles_area" class='extiw' title="wikipedia:Los_Angeles">central area</a> (from Downtown to the coast, below Sunset Blvd and above Interstate 10) the buses are frequent and ubiquitous enough to get around without a schedule. The drawback is that they are stuck in traffic just like cars. This means you may experience delays waiting for a bus, but during the morning and afternoon hours bus travel is only slightly slower than car travel once you board. Check out the <a href="http://www.mta.net/" class='external text' title="http://www.mta.net/">MTA</a> website and download <a href="http://www.mta.net/riding_metro/riders_guide/planning_trip-01.htm" class='external text' title="http://www.mta.net/riding_metro/riders_guide/planning_trip-01.htm">maps</a> and <a href="http://mtaweb5.mta.net/" class='external text' title="http://mtaweb5.mta.net/">route schedules</a>. The best routes for getting across town (east-west) are the #2 or #302(limited) on Sunset Blvd, #720 "Rapid" express service on Wilshire Blvd, and #33 or #333(limited) on Venice Blvd. Be sure to check night schedules; bus service (but not rail service) runs 24 hours but many routes change and have extremely reduced frequency in the late hours. Fares are currently $1.25 <i>per boarding</i> (no transfers) or $3.00 for a day pass (also good on Metro Rail); you can buy both from any Metro station or Metro bus driver.  Bring a street map, as MTA buses sometimes change their routes unpredictably in order to make up lost time.

<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Los_Angeles&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: By rail">edit</a>]</div><a name="By_rail"></a><h3>By rail</h3>
<p>June 2006- The Metro (www.mta.net) is now one of the easiest and cheapest ways to get around town.  $3/day pass (good until 3am) or $56/month equals unlimited access which is pretty well 24 hour service. (The Ligt rail system stops at 1am and starts again a 4am)  Traffic in LA is notoriously horrendous, not to mention with rising gas prices and astounding insurance prices, more and more angeleno's are turning to the metro as a quck and conveient way to commute and get around.  
</p><p>There are now 5 rail lines with plans to extend the red line all the way to Santa Monica, and extend the Gold Line further.  The Orange line through the San Fernando Valley (North Hollywood to Warner Center) runs on it's own bus-road with bicycle path.  All rail lines have multiple connecting buses.
</p><p>The Rapid bus system (buses only to specific heavily used stops) has also become quite popular.  
</p><p>Breakdowns are minimal and service is fast.  For instance, travelling from LAX to Hollywood during rush hour on the rail (Green to Blue to Red) takes about 40 minutes, from downtown to the west valley takes about 35 minutes, and North Hollywood to Long Beach is about 45 minutes.  
</p><p>They have improved service greatly and anyone travelling that can allow travel time almost equal to, sometimes quicker than, driving a car around L.A. should consider the Metro system.  (It's also so much cheaper, which is a huge plus!)

<hr />
<p>The Kafkaesque <b>Metro Rail</b> subway and light-rail system was designed more as a pork-barrel project to reward politically-connected construction companies than as a solution to LA's transport problems.  It is rarely useful for locals, and will not usually be a viable means of transportation for visitors.  Metro Rail is limited in geographical coverage, slow, plagued by frequent breakdowns, and crawls along on four routes that are oddly-planned and poorly connected with each other.  A twenty-five mile trip from Pasadena to LAX airport, for example, involves travel on all four lines and a shuttle bus and takes well over two hours when the system is running smoothly.  
</p><p>The rail is operated by the same agency as the bus system, so their <a href="http://www.mta.net/riding_metro/riders_guide/planning_trip-01.htm" class='external text' title="http://www.mta.net/riding_metro/riders_guide/planning_trip-01.htm">maps</a> include the rail lines. The fare structure is also the same as for the bus system.  The Metro works on a 'trust' system: you buy your tickets from machines, then get on and ride... no checking, no gates, no nothing. There are, however, Metro police that are part of the LA Sheriffs Dept. who may check for tickets on the trains or platforms, and the fines for not paying are expensive. If you ride several times chances are you will be asked to show your ticket at least once.  Be careful; if your trip involves more than one line, you have to buy a special, more expensive ticket (or just use the Day Pass).
</p><p>The Metro Rail system is composed of 5 lines:
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Red Line</b>, a subway that runs from Downtown (Union Station) through the near west side to the Hollywood area then into the San Fernando Valley. From there (North Hollywood Station) you can take the Orange Line (Busway system) to the west end of the valley.
</li><li> <b>Orange Line</b>, uses special sleek articulated "bus-trains" on rubber tires.
</li><li> <b>Blue Line</b>, runs from a  subway connection with the Red Line Downtown at 7th and Figueroa Streets at street level or higher (with some interesting views) through south Los Angeles, southward to Long Beach.
</li><li> <b>Gold Line</b>, runs from Downtown (Union Station) north to  East side of Pasadena.
</li><li> <b>Green Line</b> runs from LAX east to the city of Norwalk along Interstate 105, connecting with the Blue Line at Rosa Parks Station in Watts. It runs west to a location just south of LAX, then on to a remote part of Redondo Beach.
</li></ul>
<p>Attractions that are easily reached via the rail system, for those with plenty of time to spend on the train, include: Universal Studios, Hollywood, Thai Town, the Griffith Observatory (via a brief bus transfer on Vermont), Koreatown, the Wiltern theater, Westlake, Downtown (including the Financial District, Disney Hall, City Hall, Broadway, Little Tokyo, Chinatown, the Convention Center, and the Staples Center), Old Town Pasadena, the Watts Towers, LAX (via a free shuttle bus at Aviation Station), downtown Long Beach, and, via a frequent shuttle bus from downtown Long Beach, the Queen Mary and the Aquarium of the Pacific.
</p><p>Distinct from the Metro is the <b>Metrolink</b> <a href="http://www.metrolinktrains.com/" class='external autonumber' title="http://www.metrolinktrains.com/">[3]</a> commuter railroad system, whose city terminus is Union Station.  This commuter rail system reaches as far as Ventura, Lancaster, San Bernardino, and Oceanside (northern San Diego County), but has several severe limitations for the visitor &mdash; most notably, most lines are <b>shut down on week-ends</b>, and stops service to the suburbs <b>very early in the evenings</b> during the week, although very limited Amtrak services run on the Orange County and Ventura County Lines even when regular Metrolink trains don't.  Last but not least, your Metro Day Pass isn't valid on Metrolink, so you'll need to buy separate tickets, which aren't cheap either: a one-way from Union Station to <a href="/en/Anaheim" title="Anaheim">Anaheim</a> will set you back $6.75, although return and weekend discounts are available.

<p>While many attractions are easily served by rail, and others are adequately served by bus, you will need a <b>car</b> to fully enjoy your visit. Yes, traffic is bad, but if you want to experience L.A., you need to get a car. Some of the most interesting parts of town can be very exhausting and time-consuming to reach via public transportation. For example, if you want to visit Malibu, any beach cities other than Santa Monica and Venice, the Korean Friendship Bell (with views of the port), the Chinese communities in the San Gabriel Valley, or any part of Orange County, you are strongly advised to travel by car. There are also many spectacular natural areas surrounding the L.A. metropolitan area that you can only reach by car. See the article about <a href="/en/Driving_in_Los_Angeles_County" title="Driving in Los Angeles County">Driving in Los Angeles County</a> for more information. 
</p><p>If you are going to be driving around, make sure you have access to extensive street and freeway maps, a <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Guide" class='extiw' title="wikipedia:Thomas_Guide">Thomas Bros Guide</a></i> (a large spiral-bound street atlas), AAA offers good free maps to members from any state, or a car with an onboard navigation system. The freeways in L.A. can be confusing and overwhelming, and typically the speed of the freeway during the non-rush hours is much higher than the speed limit. If you have two or more people in your vehicle, regardless of your purpose, you may use the "Carpool Only" lanes (some require 3 people, but these will be clearly marked). There's also lots of construction work going around since the beginning of 2004 (especially late at night), so watch out for that too. Listening to a radio station is helpful for any long trip through L.A. since most stations regularly disseminate traffic information during the daylight hours. KNX 1070 AM is probably the most frequent and has a strong enough signal to be heard well outside L.A. county, so you can plan ahead. As you get closer to your destination, it will probably be too late to change course.  Note that freeways are broadcast by their <i>name</i> (i.e. Santa Monica) not their route number (I-10).  The name usually changes on opposite sides of downtown L.A. (I-10 becomes the San Bernardino)  Be sure to have an alternate route planned out in advance and know its freeway name(s) also. Traffic accident reports on the radio will give the name of the freeway interchange cross street which, unfortunately,  a non-local would have no idea where that is.  It could be so far away that you won't be affected even on the same freeway and direction. If possible, use a passenger as your navigator.  You may also check <a href="http://www.sigalert.com/map.asp?Region=Greater+Los+Angeles" class='external text' title="http://www.sigalert.com/map.asp?Region=Greater+Los+Angeles">SigAlert</a> for current traffic information before your trip. If you are traveling more than 10 or 15 miles on the freeway network, ask a local for the best route at that time of day.

<p>Los Angeles abounds with inexpensive, authentic food that represents the culinary traditions of L.A.'s many immigrant communities. In this regard, L.A., like any other city in North America, and probably the world, beats New York (and this from a New Yorker). You have to be willing to do a little legwork, go to neighborhoods you might not otherwise go to and often deal with charmless florescent-lit storefronts in strip malls, but your reward is hype-free, authentic cuisine from around the world served up at bargain prices.
</p><p>Below are a few favorites, this list can not ever be considered complete -- restaurants open and close with regularity. Spot a restaurant that looks interesting, take a chance, and if it's good, write about it here. This section especially needs tips on Vietnamese, Korean, Iranian, Central/S. American and Japanese restaurants. 
</p>
<ul><li> <b>The Original Pantry Cafe</b> 877 S Figueroa St. -- The Pantry boasts it has never closed or been without a customer since it first opened in 1924.  (Want proof?  The front entrance has no lock on it).  Come here on any morning and you will see a line stretching around the block - the wait is worth it, and the fast service will have hot plate of food in front of you within minutes of sitting down.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>  <b>Guelaguetza</b> 3337 1/2 W 8TH St. For the best mole this side of Oaxaca, go to Guelaguetza in Koreatown. The interior of Guelaguetza is actually quite charming, and oftentimes a Mexican band is playing. But the star is the mole. Three types of mole on offer. Try them all, and from then forward when you are stuck eating an everyday lunch, you will dream of Guelaguetza.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>  <b>Zankou Chicken</b> <a href="http://www.zankouchicken.com/" class='external autonumber' title="http://www.zankouchicken.com/">[6]</a> You like Chicken? Singlehandedly giving fast food a good name is this L.A. chain of Armenian restaurants, Zankou Chicken. For instance, for about $8 you can have the chicken tarna platter, which includes a pile of the most succulent, well-roasted chicken you have ever tasted, sliced into bits, pita, salad greens, pickles and peppers, and Zankou's trademark garlic paste. America will not truly taste freedom until every McDonalds in the land is replaced by a Zankou. Maybe half a dozen locations around L.A.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>The Thai restaurant behind the 7-11 on Hollywood Boulevard by the 101</b> By general, learned agreement, the most authentic Thai food in the States can be found at "the Thai restaurant behind the 7-11 on Hollywood Boulevard by the 101." That's how it is known. If you are not from L.A., this can also serve as an introduction to L.A.-style directions. (The cross street, by the way, is Taft Avenue.) The pad Thai here is light and perfumed and the curries hot enough to kill. And by authentic, exactly that is meant... don't expect any catering to farang tastes here.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Paru</b> 5140 W Sunset Blvd. For wonderful south Indian dhosas in a charming garden, try Paru. Good veg options.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Ramayani Westwood</b> 1777 Westwood Blvd. Ramayani Westwood is a good choice for Indonesian, a cuisine that is strangely and unfortunately rare in the States, given that Indonesia is the world's 4th largest country by population. Tasting menus available for the novice. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Senor Fish</b> 422 E 1ST St. Not really authentic -- it's sort of a variation on Baja-style Mexican -- Senor Fish downtown does just one thing well, but they do it better than anyone. Luckily, that one thing is an important thing: grilled fish tacos. Grilled, not fried. Their Shrimp Taco is amazing as well.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Henry's Tacos</b> 11401 Moorpark St,  North Hollywood  -- This original taco stand (circa 1961) is one great reason to make the drive into the San Fernando Valley. It's cheap, authentic tacos served fast and hot, and have become legendary in the L.A. area.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Marty's</b> Shack on the corner of Prosser and Pico Blvd. The only spot in Los Angeles that can out do Pink's chili. Also home of the Combo, which is a hot dog and hamburger all in the form of a hamburger, amazing.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Taco's Mexico</b> These ubiquitous small, red &amp; white taco stands serve typical Mexican fast food and a very low prices. They can be found almost everywhere but the Westside..probably because of the blaring Mexican polka music from the juke box&nbsp;:)
</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Grand Casino Bakery</b> This is a simple, quaint little Argentine bakery in Culver City. The "Emapanadas" are really delicious and you can always find the big screen in the dining area tuned to any soccer match. 3826 Main St, Culver City
</li></ul>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Los_Angeles&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19" title="Edit section: Superior Fast Food">edit</a>]</div><a name="Superior_Fast_Food"></a><h3>Superior Fast Food</h3>
<p>There are some local fast food places that are universally aclaimed:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Original Tommys</b> at Rampart and Beverly near downtown for cheap chili burgers.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>In-and-Out Burger</b> one of the defining fast-food chains of Southern California, and ranked one of the best in the country. Famous for its "double-doubles". Long lines can be expected during busy hours, especially due to its drive-thru style restaurants. A must for anyone who wants to get a taste of real "So-Cal" burgers. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>FatBurger</b> famous for hamburgers topped with a fried egg.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>El Pollo Loco</b> Mexican food.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Busy Bee Market</b> This has got to be the best sandwich deli in L.A. The sandwiches are relatively inexpensive (±$5 a sandwich) with generous portions of meat, served fast but really long lines during the lunch hour. Located at 2413 S. Walker Avenue,  San Pedro.
</li></ul>
<div class="editsection" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;">[<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Los_Angeles&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20" title="Edit section: Mid-range">edit</a>]</div><a name="Mid-range"></a><h3>Mid-range</h3>
<ul><li> <b>Real Food Daily</b> <a href="http://www.realfood.com" class='external autonumber' title="http://www.realfood.com">[7]</a> Vegetarians and vegans from the world over swear by Real Food Daily. Watch your favorite health and eco-conscious celebrity seal a deal over a seitan stir fry before darting off in their Mercedes SUV. Branches in Santa Monica and West Hollywood.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Alegria on Sunset</b> <a href="http://www.alegriaonsunset.com/" class='external autonumber' title="http://www.alegriaonsunset.com/">[8]</a> Try Alegria on Sunset in Silverlake for their excellent, thoughtful, modern take on Mexican classics.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Canter's Deli</b> <a href="http://www.cantersdeli.com/" class='external autonumber' title="http://www.cantersdeli.com/">[9]</a> Awesome Jewish deli on Fairfax, a few blocks north of 3rd. This place has been around for over 70 years and you'll know why if you stop by.  Its 24 hours too.  
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>The Corner Place</b> 2819 James M Wood Blvd (just east from the corner of Vermont) -- Good Korean BBQ at a really great price (around $20 is enough to stuff two people)! The decor isn't as fancy as the more expensive places, but it still has a certain charm about it. The menu's family-style, so one order is enough to feed 2 people. Like most Korean BBQ places, they'll bring the meat out for you to cook at your table and enjoy with your family and friends (but that doesn't mean you shouldn't tip). With your meal comes a variety of traditional Korean side dishes and a plate of julienned scallions to enjoy with your freshly grilled meat. For finicky eaters or those new to Korean food, the bulgoki (marinated beef) is always a good choice. On warmer days, or whenever you want a lighter meal, try having their cold noodle soup (white somen noodles in a cold soup of clear, non-spicy kimchi) with your meal instead of rice.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>  <b>BCD Tofu House</b> <a href="http://www.bcdtofu.com/" class='external autonumber' title="http://www.bcdtofu.com/">[10]</a> Various locations in Koreatown, Downtown, and Greater Los Angeles -- Their menu includes various types of soon tofu stews (at around $8) and combination meals that include other traditional Korean entrees (Korean BBQ, bibimbap, etc.) along with a small bowl of soon tofu stew (at around $11-$14). Each order comes with a bowl of rice and the standard array of traditional Korean side dishes served at most Korean restaurants. Service and atmosphere are always great (the decor at the location on Wilshire is particularly nice). For those new to eating soon tofu, especially at this restaurant, there is a certain order of things to follow in eating this meal (such as cracking the raw egg into the stew while it's still boiling, though it's up to you whether or not you want to add egg to your stew). So don't be afraid to wave your server down and ask questions (many Korean restaurants have implemented little wireless bells at each table in case you have a particularly hard time getting ahold of any servers). Several locations (including the 2 in Koreatown) are open 24 hours.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Langer’s Deli</b>, 704 S. Alvarado Street, (213) 483-8050 across the street from MacArthur Park. Their devoted patrons swear they make the best pastrami sandwiches in Los Angeles.  
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>El Arco Iris</b>, 5684 York Boulevard (90042) in Highland Park, www.elarcoiris.com. For good Mexican food and margaritas in one of L.A.’s oldest neighborhoods, visit this family restaurant.

Unashamedly post-modernist, with latino/east-asian cuisine and a choice of white-party indoor dining or outdoor seating among the oversized flower pots.

<ul><li><b>Matsuhisa</b> 129 N La Cienega Blvd. The original restaurant of one of the most influential sushi chefs in the world. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Urasawa</b> 218 North Rodeo Drive. When Masa Takayama relocated to New York, his assistant, Hiro Urasawa took over the space. The space still has the most expensive restaurant in California, but it's well worth it for sushi fanatics.

<p>The cultural diversity of Los Angeles is an evident influence on the local vegetarian food restaurant industry. Where else but L.A. can you find strictly vegan and vegetarian dining, be it Chinese, Ethiopian, Mexican, Thai, American, International Fusion, Vegan Macrobiotic, and Raw Gourmet restaurants? Vegetarian food can be as creative and diverse as the city's inhabitants. Finding 100% vegetarian restaurants in Los Angeles can still be difficult and a <a href="http://www.happycow.net/cityguide_los_angeles.html" class='external text' title="http://www.happycow.net/cityguide_los_angeles.html">city guide</a> is useful in locating them.

</p>
<ul><li> <b>Native Foods</b> 1110 Gayley Ave. Westwood <a href="http://www.nativefoods.com" class='external autonumber' title="http://www.nativefoods.com">[12]</a> Innvoative variety of vegan foods, featuring salads, veggie burgers, rice and noodle bowls, pizzas, and desserts.

</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Vegan Glory</b> 8393 Beverly Blvd.<a href="http://www.veganglory.com" class='external autonumber' title="http://www.veganglory.com">[13]</a> Offers a variety of soy meat-substitutes &amp; tofu choices in the entrees.

<p>It's hard to summarize the plethora of hotel options in L.A. From some of the most opulent (and expensive) resorts in the world to budget hostels to apartment-hotel crash pads, there's something for everyone. Deciding where to stay will have a lot to do with what areas you plan on visiting, and how you're going to get there. As usual in Southern California, a car opens up a world of options, but be sure to check the parking arrangement at your accommodations before you arrive.

<p>Hollywood is a good place to stay for at least three reasons:
</p>
<dl><dd>1. Street life there remains lively to a later hour than in most other areas, making the district a satisfying location to come home to. In fact, the best time to see Hollywood is in the evening, since the district serves, along with the nearby Sunset Strip, as the regional center for clubs and nightlife.
</dd><dd>2. There is a wide range in price and quality of accommodations. The modern Renaissance Hotel and the antique Roosevelt Hotel provide an upscale choice, and there is a full range of standard motel chains including Travelodge, Motel 6, and Best Western. There are also a few well-located Hostels.
</dd><dd>3. Hollywood’s location is central to most other popular attractions. The Red Line subway stations at Hollywood/Vine and Hollywood/Highland can connect you to the many city areas accessible by <a href="/en/Los_Angeles#By_Rail" title="Los Angeles"> rail</a>, and the stretch of Hollywood Blvd between Highland and Vine serves as a focal node of the <a href="/en/Los_Angeles#By_Bus" title="Los Angeles"> bus</a> system. Hollywood is also near enough to the <a href="/en/West_Side_%28Los_Angeles_County%29" title="West Side (Los Angeles County)">Westside</a> to make <a href="/en/Los_Angeles#By_Car" title="Los Angeles"> car</a> trips there relatively easy, and the center of the freeway network (Downtown) is nearby, making long distance car travel relatively simple.
</dd></dl>
<p>The main east-west streets of central Hollywood are Hollywood Blvd and Sunset Blvd, crossed by the main north-south streets of La Brea Ave, Highland Ave, Cahuenga Blvd, Vine St, and Gower St. Any location within a few blocks of the intersections of these streets is likely to be a satisfying choice. Night-time pedestrian activity in this area is focused on Hollywood Blvd.

<p>Los Angeles is similar to other major metropolitan areas in that travel within certain parts of the city at night should be conducted with caution and only in groups. As with any large city, do not walk alone at night, male or female. Most areas are safe in the daytime, but traveling in groups is still a prudent precaution. Most homeless individuals are harmless and if you are asked for money a polite refusal will typically be adequate. Certain areas of <a href="/en/Los_Angeles/Downtown" title="Los Angeles/Downtown"> Downtown</a> where much of the homeless population spends the night are known as Skid Row. These areas can be violent and should be avoided at night even by groups. Other than that most areas are safe for groups (who pay attention) after dark. Gangs should not be a major concern. They do persist throughout the region (not only in South Central Los Angeles) but they have no reason to be interested in you.
</p><p>In the unlikely (although not as unlikely as in the rest of the country) event of a major earthquake, duck and cover and stay where you are during the shaking, then go outside once the shaking stops. Buildings and other structures are unlikely to collapse. Your largest threats come from breaking windows and falling objects such as ceiling tiles and bookshelves. Try to get under a table, desk, or doorjam to reduce your exposure to these threats. You are more likely to be injured if you try to run during the shaking.
