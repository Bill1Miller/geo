the opening receptions are scheduled for the evening of Thursday, December

<p><a NAME="Program"></a><b><font size=+2>Program</font></b></center>



<p>This meeting provides an outstanding opportunity for researchers, teachers,

students, and consultants to review the

<br>latest issues affecting the Earth, the planets, and their environment

in space.

<p>You may contribute to the success of this meeting by having suggested

a special meeting topic or session.&nbsp; Approved topics and sessions

available on the web.&nbsp; You may also submit an abstract and attend

the meeting. This meeting will cover topics in all areas of geophysical

sciences, and therefore contributed papers on any topic in geophysics are

encouraged. Because of the close ties between many aspects of geophysics,

special steps are being taken to facilitate sessions involving multiple

sections. These include the scheduling of Union sessions and the joint

sponsorship of sessions by multiple sections.

<p>This meeting specifically targets themes that cut across multiple disciplines,

providing attendees with different avenues

<br>in which to find sessions in their particular areas of interest.
