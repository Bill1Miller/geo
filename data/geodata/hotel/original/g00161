The European Space Agency (ESA) has been practicing software methodology and standards for 2 decades very successfully in the domain of ground segment software systems engineering.

This process has been in constant evolution and will further evolve significantly.  Therefore, it is important to capitalize on the lessons learned to find solutions to the past problems and avoid  them in the future.  The talk will address the management aspects of using software engineering methodologies rather than the methodology theories themselves.

<b>Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Kaufeler</b> graduated as an engineer from L'Ecole Sup&eacute;rieure d'Electricit&eacute; (Paris) in 1969.  His specialization is Information Technology, and he started his career at Honeywell Bull

in the field of operational research.  He joined the European Space Agency (ESA) at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in 1974 and has designed ESA's Mission Control  Systems using different generations of software technology.  In 1992 he was nominated Head of the Mission Control Systems Division.  Since 2001 has been Head of the Ground Segment  Engineering Department, and was Head of the ESOC Establishment in the period 2001-2003.
