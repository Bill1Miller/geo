        <p><font size="2">The field of Clinical Social Work has changed dramatically in the past 15 years. The fluidity of change continues with the passage of Prop 63, the Mental Health Services Act, the changing cultural mix of the state, the formation of new national affiliations available to clinicians, and changes to the California license. This panel will discuss in detail the implications of these changes on practice and on the profession of Clinical Social Work, with an emphasis on future trends in public and private mental health care.</font></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">A necessary tool for any trauma therapist is to assist clients in learning to manage nervous system excitation. Maintaining optimal levels of arousal facilitates clear thinking, separation of past and present, and the ability to distinguish danger from safety. Using neuroscience theory together with cognitive and somatic interventions, this presentation will help the practitioner to assist the client to avoid decompensating while enhancing therapeutic integration. These techniques work regardless of the therapeutic model being applied. </font></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">The technique of psychodynamic psychotherapy has lagged behind our scientific understanding of anxiety and brain neuroscience. The most common sequelae of adult and childhood trauma is anxiety. This presentation will demonstrate pathways of unconscious anxiety, how to recognize them, how to identify  pathogenic defenses, and how to  heal the source of the anxiety in a  reasonable period of time. The role of medication in healing trauma will be discussed. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2">This workshop will provide an overview of the assessment and treatment methodology of sexual addiction and compulsivity as it relates to adult survivors.

          <p><font size="2">Somatic Experiencing&reg; (SE) is a naturalistic mind/body approach to trauma treatment developed by Dr. Peter Levine.  This workshop provides a brief introduction to the SE model which is based, in part, upon Dr. Levine&rsquo;s observations of wild animals&rsquo; responses to threat.  In SE, the nervous system is viewed as having an inherent capacity for self-regulation which can be restored through resolving the impact of trauma.  This will be illustrated by a DVD showing Dr. Levine using Somatic Experiencing&reg; with a survivor of the Twin Towers attack on 9/11.  The presenters, Phyllis Mabbett, RN, Ph.D, and Nicola Ranson, LCSW will also describe the application of SE with tsunami victims and survivors of torture, as well as with clients who present with other problems such as substance abuse, but have unresolved trauma as an underlying diagnosis. This workshop will include an experiential component in order for participants to increase their awareness of the physiological responses to both threat and to safety.</font></p>
