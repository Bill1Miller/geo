Be prepared to see more shows, concerts, exhibitions,        operas, and dance that you ever thought you would. Get ready for delicious        food, roaring ethnic diversity, and streets bursting with bustling excitement. </p>    <p>Throughout the first week of the semester in New York, the Program Assistant      will be taking students to NYU and through Chelsea on separate walking      tours. Students will also be thoroughly introduced to the subway system      and to other different New York neighborhoods. The Program Assistant will      also be living in the New Yorker Hotel with the students. Students will      be able to approach the Program Assistant with any problems they may be      experiencing and the Program Assistant can take steps towards alleviating      those concerns. Students will quickly learn the city and be able to function      in their environment with ease. </p>    <h1 class="style6"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Housing</strong></font></h1>    <p>Students will live in the New Yorker Hotel at 8 th Avenue and 34 th Street.      Convenient to the A, C, E, 1, 2, 3, 9, B, F, N, R, W, and Q trains, the      hotel offers comfortable double or single rooms with private baths and      views of the Empire State Building, the Chrystler Building, Madison Square      Garden, or the Hudson River. Secure and well-located, the site allows students      access to NYU, Lincoln Center, the theatre district, Chelsea, Madison Square      Garden, Penn Station, and the major shopping available along 34 th Street.      Amenities such as laundry, dry-cleaning, internet access, and food are      available in or near the hotel. Some students may even be within blocks      of their internships.</p>    <p>Rooms at the New Yorker Hotel are contracted out to Duke University by      Educational Housing Services, Inc. EHS rents the 16 th , 27 th , 28 th      , and 29 th floors of the hotel. EHS has a Resident Director who lives      in the hotel as well as three RAs--one of whom is on duty at all times.      Double rooms contain a closet, dresser, two desks with lamps, single beds,      a private bathroom, color television with cable, a small refrigerator,      and a telephone which can be used for local calls. All rooms are equipped      with internet access, as well. Students will also have access to a 24-diner,      a group student kitchen area, a student lounge, computer lab, laundry facilities,      and gym. &nbsp; </p>    <p>Although students live in the New Yorker Hotel, the rooms in which they stay      are dorm rooms. Sheets, blankets, pillows, towels, personal items, etc.,      are not included in the rooms. Cooking utensils, cleaning supplies, radio/stereo,      and hangers are other items that should be brought to the New Yorker Hotel    by the students. </p>    <p><img src="images/rooms.jpg" width="412" height="102"></p></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
